      "  \"history\": \"Lua was created in 1993 by Roberto Ierusalimschy, Luiz Henrique de Figueiredo and Waldemar Celes, members of the Computer Graphics Technology Group (Tecgraf) at the Pontifical Catholic University of Rio de Janeiro, in Brazil. From 1977 until 1992, Brazil had a policy of strong trade barriers (called a market reserve) for computer hardware and software, believing that Brazil could and should produce its own hardware and software. In that climate, Tecgraf's clients could not afford, either politically or financially, to buy customized software from abroad; under the market reserve, clients would have to go through a complex bureaucratic process to prove their needs couldn't be met by Brazilian companies. Those reasons led Tecgraf to implement the basic tools it needed from scratch. Lua's predecessors were the data-description/configuration languages Simple Object Language (SOL) and data-entry language (DEL). They had been independently developed at Tecgraf in 1992–1993 to add some flexibility into two different projects (both were interactive graphical programs for engineering applications at Petrobras company). There was a lack of any flow-control structures in SOL and DEL, and Petrobras felt a growing need to add full programming power to them. In The Evolution of Lua, the language's authors wrote: In 1993, the only real contender was Tcl, which had been explicitly designed to be embedded into applications. However, Tcl had unfamiliar syntax, did not offer good support for data description, and ran only on Unix platforms. We did not consider LISP or Scheme because of their unfriendly syntax. Python was still in its infancy. In the free, do-it-yourself atmosphere that then reigned in Tecgraf, it was quite natural that we should try to develop our own scripting language ... Because many potential users of the language were not professional programmers, the language should avoid cryptic syntax and semantics. The implementation of the new language should be highly portable, because Tecgraf's clients had a very diverse collection of computer platforms. Finally, since we expected that other Tecgraf products would also need to embed a scripting language, the new language should follow the example of SOL and be provided as a library with a C API. Lua 1.0 was designed in such a way that its object constructors, being then slightly different from the current light and flexible style, incorporated the data-description syntax of SOL (hence the name Lua: Sol meaning Sun in Portuguese, and Lua meaning Moon). Lua syntax for control structures was mostly borrowed from Modula (if, while, repeat/until), but also had taken influence from CLU (multiple assignments and multiple returns from function calls, as a simpler alternative to reference parameters or explicit pointers), C++ (neat idea of allowing a local variable to be declared only where we need it), SNOBOL and AWK (associative arrays). In an article published in Dr. Dobb's Journal, Lua's creators also state that LISP and Scheme with their single, ubiquitous data-structure mechanism (the list) were a major influence on their decision to develop the table as the primary data structure of Lua. Lua semantics have been increasingly influenced by Scheme over time, especially with the introduction of anonymous functions and full lexical scoping. Several features were added in new Lua versions. Versions of Lua prior to version 5.0 were released under a license similar to the BSD license. From version 5.0 onwards, Lua has been licensed under the MIT License. Both are permissive free software licences and are almost identical.\",\n",
      "  \"features\": \"Lua is commonly described as a multi-paradigm language, providing a small set of general features that can be extended to fit different problem types. Lua does not contain explicit support for inheritance, but allows it to be implemented with metatables. Similarly, Lua allows programmers to implement namespaces, classes and other related features using its single table implementation; first-class functions allow the employment of many techniques from functional programming and full lexical scoping allows fine-grained information hiding to enforce the principle of least privilege. In general, Lua strives to provide simple, flexible meta-features that can be extended as needed, rather than supply a feature-set specific to one programming paradigm. As a result, the base language is light; the full reference interpreter is only about 247 kB compiled and easily adaptable to a broad range of applications. As a dynamically typed language intended for use as an extension language or scripting language, Lua is compact enough to fit on a variety of host platforms. It supports only a small number of atomic data structures such as Boolean values, numbers (double-precision floating point and 64-bit integers by default) and strings. Typical data structures such as arrays, sets, lists and records can be represented using Lua's single native data structure, the table, which is essentially a heterogeneous associative array. Lua implements a small set of advanced features such as first-class functions, garbage collection, closures, proper tail calls, coercion (automatic conversion between string and number values at run time), coroutines (cooperative multitasking) and dynamic module loading.\",\n",
      "  \"syntax\": \"The classic Hello, World! program can be written as follows, with or without parentheses:[a] print(Hello, World!) print Hello, World! The declaration of a variable, without a value. local variable The declaration of a variable with a value of 10. local students = 10 A comment in Lua starts with a double-hyphen and runs to the end of the line, similar to Ada, Eiffel, Haskell, SQL and VHDL. Multi-line strings and comments are marked with double square brackets. -- Single line comment --[[ Multi-line comment --]] The factorial function is implemented in this example: function factorial(n) local x = 1 for i = 2, n do x = x * i end return x end\",\n",
      "  \"control_flow\": \"Lua has one type of conditional test: if then end with optional else and elseif then execution control constructs. The generic if then end statement requires all three keywords: if condition then --statement body end An example of an if statement if x ~= 10 then print(x) end The else keyword may be added with an accompanying statement block to control execution when the if condition evaluates to false: if condition then --statement body else --statement body end An example of an if else statement if x == 10 then print(10) else print(x) end Execution may also be controlled according to multiple conditions using the elseif then keywords: if condition then --statement body elseif condition then --statement body else -- optional --optional default statement body end An example of an if elseif else statement if x == y then print(x = y) elseif x == z then print(x = z) else -- optional print(x does not equal any other variable) end Lua has four types of conditional loops: the while loop, the repeat loop (similar to a do while loop), the numeric for loop and the generic for loop. --condition = true while condition do --statements end repeat --statements until condition for i = first, last, delta do --delta may be negative, allowing the for loop to count down or up --statements --example: print(i) end This generic for loop would iterate over the table _G using the standard iterator function pairs, until it returns nil: for key, value in pairs(_G) do print(key, value) end Loops can also be nested (put inside of another loop). local grid = { { 11, 12, 13 }, { 21, 22, 23 }, { 31, 32, 33 } } for y, row in pairs(grid) do for x, value in pairs(row) do print(x, y, value) end end\",\n",
      "  \"functions\": \"Lua's treatment of functions as first-class values is shown in the following example, where the print function's behavior is modified: do local oldprint = print -- Store current print function as oldprint function print(s) --[[ Redefine print function. The usual print function can still be used through oldprint. The new one has only one argument.]] oldprint(s == foo and bar or s) end end Any future calls to print will now be routed through the new function, and because of Lua's lexical scoping, the old print function will only be accessible by the new, modified print. Lua also supports closures, as demonstrated below: function addto(x) -- Return a new function that adds x to the argument return function(y) --[[ When we refer to the variable x, which is outside the current scope and whose lifetime would be shorter than that of this anonymous function, Lua creates a closure.]] return x + y end end fourplus = addto(4) print(fourplus(3)) -- Prints 7 --This can also be achieved by calling the function in the following way: print(addto(4)(3)) --[[ This is because we are calling the returned function from 'addto(4)' with the argument '3' directly. This also helps to reduce data cost and up performance if being called iteratively.]] A new closure for the variable x is created every time addto is called, so that each new anonymous function returned will always access its own x parameter. The closure is managed by Lua's garbage collector, just like any other object.\",\n",
      "  \"tables\": \"Tables are the most important data structures (and, by design, the only built-in composite data type) in Lua and are the foundation of all user-created types. They are associative arrays with addition of automatic numeric key and special syntax. A table is a set of key and data pairs, where the data is referenced by key; in other words, it is a hashed heterogeneous associative array. Tables are created using the {} constructor syntax. a_table = {} -- Creates a new, empty table Tables are always passed by reference (see Call by sharing). A key (index) can be any value except nil and NaN, including functions. a_table = {x = 10} -- Creates a new table, with one entry mapping x to the number 10. print(a_table[x]) -- Prints the value associated with the string key, in this case 10. b_table = a_table b_table[x] = 20 -- The value in the table has been changed to 20. print(b_table[x]) -- Prints 20. print(a_table[x]) -- Also prints 20, because a_table and b_table both refer to the same table. A table is often used as structure (or record) by using strings as keys. Because such use is very common, Lua features a special syntax for accessing such fields. point = { x = 10, y = 20 } -- Create new table print(point[x]) -- Prints 10 print(point.x) -- Has exactly the same meaning as line above. The easier-to-read dot notation is just syntactic sugar. By using a table to store related functions, it can act as a namespace. Point = {} Point.new = function(x, y) return {x = x, y = y} -- return {[x] = x, [y] = y} end Point.set_x = function(point, x) point.x = x -- point[x] = x; end Tables are automatically assigned a numerical key, enabling them to be used as an array data type. The first automatic index is 1 rather than 0 as it is for many other programming languages (though an explicit index of 0 is allowed). A numeric key 1 is distinct from a string key 1. array = { a, b, c, d } -- Indices are assigned automatically. print(array) -- Prints b. Automatic indexing in Lua starts at 1. print(#array) -- Prints 4. # is the length operator for tables and strings. array = z -- Zero is a legal index. print(#array) -- Still prints 4, as Lua arrays are 1-based. The length of a table t is defined to be any integer index n such that t[n] is not nil and t[n+1] is nil; moreover, if t is nil, n can be zero. For a regular array, with non-nil values from 1 to a given n, its length is exactly that n, the index of its last value. If the array has holes (that is, nil values between other non-nil values), then #t can be any of the indices that directly precedes a nil value (that is, it may consider any such nil value as the end of the array). ExampleTable = { {1, 2, 3, 4}, {5, 6, 7, 8} } print(ExampleTable) -- Prints 3 print(ExampleTable) -- Prints 8 A table can be an array of objects. function Point(x, y) -- Point object constructor return { x = x, y = y } -- Creates and returns a new object (table) end array = { Point(10, 20), Point(30, 40), Point(50, 60) } -- Creates array of points -- array = { { x = 10, y = 20 }, { x = 30, y = 40 }, { x = 50, y = 60 } }; print(array.y) -- Prints 40 Using a hash map to emulate an array is normally slower than using an actual array; however, Lua tables are optimized for use as arrays to help avoid this issue.\",\n",
      "  \"metatables\": \"Extensible semantics is a key feature of Lua, and the metatable concept allows powerful customization of tables. The following example demonstrates an infinite table. For any n, fibs[n] will give the n-th Fibonacci number using dynamic programming and memoization. fibs = { 1, 1 } -- Initial values for fibs and fibs. setmetatable(fibs, { __index = function(values, n) --[[__index is a function predefined by Lua, it is called if key n does not exist.]] values[n] = values[n - 1] + values[n - 2] -- Calculate and memoize fibs[n]. return values[n] end })\",\n",
      "  \"object_oriented_programming\": \"Although Lua does not have a built-in concept of classes, object-oriented programming can be emulated using functions and tables. An object is formed by putting methods and fields in a table. Inheritance (both single and multiple) can be implemented with metatables, delegating nonexistent methods and fields to a parent object. There is no such concept as class with these techniques; rather, prototypes are used, similar to Self or JavaScript. New objects are created either with a factory method (that constructs new objects from scratch) or by cloning an existing object. Creating a basic vector object: local Vector = {} local VectorMeta = { __index = Vector} function Vector.new(x, y, z) -- The constructor return setmetatable({x = x, y = y, z = z}, VectorMeta) end function Vector.magnitude(self) -- Another method return math.sqrt(self.x^2 + self.y^2 + self.z^2) end local vec = Vector.new(0, 1, 0) -- Create a vector print(vec.magnitude(vec)) -- Call a method (output: 1) print(vec.x) -- Access a member variable (output: 0) Here, setmetatable tells Lua to look for an element in the Vector table if it is not present in the vec table. vec.magnitude, which is equivalent to vec[magnitude], first looks in the vec table for the magnitude element. The vec table does not have a magnitude element, but its metatable delegates to the Vector table for the magnitude element when it's not found in the vec table. Lua provides some syntactic sugar to facilitate object orientation. To declare member functions inside a prototype table, one can use function table:func(args), which is equivalent to function table.func(self, args). Calling class methods also makes use of the colon: object:func(args) is equivalent to object.func(object, args). That in mind, here is a corresponding class with : syntactic sugar: local Vector = {} Vector.__index = Vector function Vector:new(x, y, z) -- The constructor -- Since the function definition uses a colon, -- its first argument is self which refers -- to Vector return setmetatable({x = x, y = y, z = z}, self) end function Vector:magnitude() -- Another method -- Reference the implicit object using self return math.sqrt(self.x^2 + self.y^2 + self.z^2) end local vec = Vector:new(0, 1, 0) -- Create a vector print(vec:magnitude()) -- Call a method (output: 1) print(vec.x) -- Access a member variable (output: 0)\",\n",
      "  \"inheritance\": \"Lua supports using metatables to give Lua class inheritance. In this example, we allow vectors to have their values multiplied by a constant in a derived class. local Vector = {} Vector.__index = Vector function Vector:new(x, y, z) -- The constructor -- Here, self refers to whatever class's new -- method we call. In a derived class, self will -- be the derived class; in the Vector class, self -- will be Vector return setmetatable({x = x, y = y, z = z}, self) end function Vector:magnitude() -- Another method -- Reference the implicit object using self return math.sqrt(self.x^2 + self.y^2 + self.z^2) end -- Example of class inheritance local VectorMult = {} VectorMult.__index = VectorMult setmetatable(VectorMult, Vector) -- Make VectorMult a child of Vector function VectorMult:multiply(value) self.x = self.x * value self.y = self.y * value self.z = self.z * value return self end local vec = VectorMult:new(0, 1, 0) -- Create a vector print(vec:magnitude()) -- Call a method (output: 1) print(vec.y) -- Access a member variable (output: 1) vec:multiply(2) -- Multiply all components of vector by 2 print(vec.y) -- Access member again (output: 2) Lua also supports multiple inheritance; __index can either be a function or a table. Operator overloading can also be done; Lua metatables can have elements such as __add, __sub and so on.\",\n",

The compiling process is typically invisible to the user and is performed during run-time, especially when a just-in-time compilation (JIT) compiler is used, but it can be done offline to increase loading performance or reduce the memory footprint of the host environment by leaving out the compiler. Lua bytecode can also be produced and executed from within Lua, using the dump function from the string library and the load/loadstring/loadfile functions. Lua version 5.3.4 is implemented in approximately 24,000 lines of C code. Like most CPUs, and unlike most virtual machines (which are stack-based), the Lua VM is register-based, and therefore more closely resembles most hardware design. The register architecture both avoids excessive copying of values, and reduces the total number of instructions per function. The virtual machine of Lua 5 is one of the first register-based pure VMs to have a wide use. Parrot and Android's Dalvik are two other well-known register-based VMs. PCScheme's VM was also register-based. This example is the bytecode listing of the factorial function defined above (as shown by the luac 5.1 compiler): function <factorial.lua:1,7> (9 instructions, 36 bytes at 0x8063c60) 1 param, 6 slots, 0 upvalues, 6 locals, 2 constants, 0 functions 1 LOADK 1 -1 ; 1 2 LOADK 2 -2 ; 2 3 MOVE 3 0 4 LOADK 4 -1 ; 1 5 FORPREP 2 1 ; to 7 6 MUL 1 1 5 7 FORLOOP 2 -2 ; to 6 8 RETURN 1 2 9 RETURN 0 1\",\n",
      "  \"c_api\": \"Lua is intended to be embedded into other applications, and provides a C API for this purpose. The API is divided into two parts: the Lua core and the Lua auxiliary library. The Lua API's design eliminates the need for manual reference counting (management) in C code, unlike Python's API. The API, like the language, is minimalist. Advanced functions are provided by the auxiliary library, which consists largely of preprocessor macros which assist with complex table operations. The Lua C API is stack based. Lua provides functions to push and pop most simple C data types (integers, floats, etc.) to and from the stack, and functions to manipulate tables through the stack. The Lua stack is somewhat different from a traditional stack; the stack can be indexed directly, for example. Negative indices indicate offsets from the top of the stack. For example, −1 is the top (most recently pushed value), while positive indices indicate offsets from the bottom (oldest value). Marshalling data between C and Lua functions is also done using the stack. To call a Lua function, arguments are pushed onto the stack, and then the lua_call is used to call the actual function. When writing a C function to be directly called from Lua, the arguments are read from the stack. Here is an example of calling a Lua function from C: #include <stdio.h> #include <lua.h> // Lua main library (lua_*) #include <lauxlib.h> // Lua auxiliary library (luaL_*) int main(void) { // create a Lua state lua_State *L = luaL_newstate(); // load and execute a string if (luaL_dostring(L, function foo (x,y) return x+y end)) { lua_close(L); return -1; } // push value of global foo (the function defined above) // to the stack, followed by integers 5 and 3 lua_getglobal(L, foo); lua_pushinteger(L, 5); lua_pushinteger(L, 3); lua_call(L, 2, 1); // call a function with two arguments and one return value printf(Result: %d\\\\n, lua_tointeger(L, -1)); // print integer value of item at stack top lua_pop(L, 1); // return stack to original state lua_close(L); // close Lua state return 0; } Running this example gives: $ cc -o example example.c -llua $ ./example Result: 8 The C API also provides some special tables, located at various pseudo-indices in the Lua stack. At LUA_GLOBALSINDEX prior to Lua 5.2 is the globals table, _G from within Lua, which is the main namespace. There is also a registry located at LUA_REGISTRYINDEX where C programs can store Lua values for later retrieval.\",\n",
      "  \"modules\": \"Besides standard library (core) modules it is possible to write extensions using the Lua API. Extension modules are shared objects which can be used to extend the functions of the interpreter by providing native facilities to Lua scripts. Lua scripts may load extension modules using require, just like modules written in Lua itself, or with package.loadlib. When a C library is loaded via require('foo') Lua will look for the function luaopen_foo and call it, which acts as any C function callable from Lua and generally returns a table filled with methods. A growing set of modules termed rocks are available through a package management system named LuaRocks, in the spirit of CPAN, RubyGems and Python eggs. Prewritten Lua bindings exist for most popular programming languages, including other scripting languages. For C++, there are a number of template-based approaches and some automatic binding generators.\",\n",
      "  \"applications\": \"Main article: List of applications using Lua In video game development, Lua is widely used as a scripting language, mainly due to its perceived easiness to embed, fast execution, and short learning curve. Notable games which use Lua include Roblox, Garry's Mod, World of Warcraft, Payday 2, Phantasy Star Online 2, Dota 2, Crysis, and many others. Some games that do not natively support Lua programming or scripting, have this function added by mods, as ComputerCraft does for Minecraft. Also, Lua is used in non-video game software, such as Adobe Lightroom, Moho, iClone, Aerospike, and some system software in FreeBSD and NetBSD, and used as a template scripting language on MediaWiki using the Scribunto extension. In 2003, a poll conducted by GameDev.net showed Lua was the most popular scripting language for game programming. On 12 January 2012, Lua was announced as a winner of the Front Line Award 2011 from the magazine Game Developer in the category Programming Tools. Many non-game applications also use Lua for extensibility, such as LuaTeX, an implementation of the TeX type-setting language, Redis, a key-value database, ScyllaDB, a wide-column store, Neovim, a text editor, Nginx, a web server, Wireshark, a network packet analyzer and Pure Data, a visual audio programming language (through the pdlua extension). Through the Scribunto extension, Lua is available as a server-side scripting language in the MediaWiki software that runs Wikipedia and other wikis. Among its uses are allowing the integration of data from Wikidata into articles, and powering the automated taxobox system.\",\n",

      "  \"early_history\": \"PHP development began in 1993 when Rasmus Lerdorf wrote several Common Gateway Interface (CGI) programs in C, which he used to maintain his personal homepage. He extended them to work with web forms and to communicate with databases, and called this implementation Personal Home Page/Forms Interpreter or PHP/FI. An example of the early PHP syntax: <!--include /text/header.html--> <!--getenv HTTP_USER_AGENT--> <!--if substr $exec_result Mozilla--> Hey, you are using Netscape!<p> <!--endif--> <!--sql database select * from table where user='$username'--> <!--ifless $numentries 1--> Sorry, that record does not exist<p> <!--endif exit--> Welcome <!--$user-->!<p> You have <!--$index:0--> credits left in your account.<p> <!--include /text/footer.html--> PHP/FI could be used to build simple, dynamic web applications. To accelerate bug reporting and improve the code, Lerdorf initially announced the release of PHP/FI as Personal Home Page Tools (PHP Tools) version 1.0 on the Usenet discussion group comp.infosystems.www.authoring.cgi on 8 June 1995. This release included basic functionality such as Perl-like variables, form handling, and the ability to embed HTML. By this point, the syntax had changed to resemble that of Perl, but was simpler, more limited, and less consistent. Early PHP was never intended to be a new programming language; rather, it grew organically, with Lerdorf noting in retrospect: I don't know how to stop it [...] there was never any intent to write a programming language [...] I have absolutely no idea how to write a programming language [...] I just kept adding the next logical step on the way. A development team began to form and, after months of work and beta testing, officially released PHP/FI 2 in November 1997. The fact that PHP was not originally designed, but instead was developed organically has led to inconsistent naming of functions and inconsistent ordering of their parameters. In some cases, the function names were chosen to match the lower-level libraries which PHP was wrapping, while in some very early versions of PHP the length of the function names was used internally as a hash function, so names were chosen to improve the distribution of hash values.\",\n",
      "  \"php__and_\": \"This is an example of PHP code for the WordPress content management system. Zeev Suraski and Andi Gutmans rewrote the parser in 1997 and formed the base of PHP 3, changing the language's name to the recursive acronym PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor. Afterwards, public testing of PHP 3 began, and the official launch came in June 1998. Suraski and Gutmans then started a new rewrite of PHP's core, producing the Zend Engine in 1999. They also founded Zend Technologies in Ramat Gan, Israel. On 22 May 2000, PHP 4, powered by the Zend Engine 1.0, was released. By August 2008, this branch had reached version 4.4.9. PHP 4 is now no longer under development and nor are any security updates planned to be released.\",\n",
      "  \"php_\": \"PHP 8.4 was released on November 21, 2024.\",\n",
      "  \"php__and_unicode\": \"PHP received mixed reviews due to lacking native Unicode support at the core language level. In 2005, a project headed by Andrei Zmievski was initiated to bring native Unicode support throughout PHP, by embedding the International Components for Unicode (ICU) library, and representing text strings as UTF-16 internally. Since this would cause major changes both to the internals of the language and to user code, it was planned to release this as version 6.0 of the language, along with other major features then in development. However, a shortage of developers who understood the necessary changes, and performance problems arising from conversion to and from UTF-16, which is rarely used in a web context, led to delays in the project. As a result, a PHP 5.3 release was created in 2009, with many non-Unicode features back-ported from PHP 6, notably namespaces. In March 2010, the project in its current form was officially abandoned, and a PHP 5.4 release was prepared to contain most remaining non-Unicode features from PHP 6, such as traits and closure re-binding. Initial hopes were that a new plan would be formed for Unicode integration, but by 2014 none had been adopted.[citation needed]\",\n",

PHP 8's JIT compiler can provide substantial performance improvements for some use cases, while (then PHP) developer Nikita Popov stated that the performance improvements for most websites will be less substantial than the upgrade from PHP 5 to PHP 7. Substantial improvements are expected more for mathematical-type operations than for common web-development use cases. Additionally, the JIT compiler provides the future potential to move some code from C to PHP, due to the performance improvements for some use cases.\",\n",

      "  \"type_changes_and_additions\": \"PHP 8 introduced union types, a new static return type, and a new mixed type. Attributes, often referred to as annotations in other programming languages, were added in PHP 8, which allow metadata to be added to classes. throw was changed from being a statement to being an expression. This allows exceptions to be thrown in places that were not previously possible.\",\n",
      "  \"syntax_changes_and_additions\": \"PHP 8 includes changes to allow alternate, more concise, or more consistent syntaxes in a number of scenarios. For example, the nullsafe operator is similar to the null coalescing operator ??, but used when calling methods. The following code snippet will not throw an error if getBirthday() returns null: $human_readable_date = $user->getBirthday()?->diffForHumans(); Constructor property promotion has been added as syntactic sugar, allowing class properties to be set automatically when parameters are passed into a class constructor. This reduces the amount of boilerplate code that must be written. Other minor changes include support for use of ::class on objects, which serves as an alternative for the use of get_class(); non-capturing catches in try-catch blocks; variable syntax tweaks to resolve inconsistencies; support for named arguments; and support for trailing commas in parameter lists, which adds consistency with support for trailing commas in other contexts, such as in arrays.\",\n",

      "  \"mascot\": \"The elePHPant, PHP mascot The mascot of the PHP project is the elePHPant, a blue elephant with the PHP logo on its side, designed by Vincent Pontier in 1998. The (PHP) letters were forming the shape of an elephant if viewed in a sideways angle. The elePHPant is sometimes differently coloured when in plush toy form. Many variations of this mascot have been made over the years. Only the elePHPants based on the original design by Vincent Pontier are considered official by the community. These are collectable and some of them are extremely rare.\",\n",
      "  \"syntax\": \"Main article: PHP syntax and semantics A Hello, World application in PHP 7.4 running on its built-in development server The following Hello, World! program is written in PHP code embedded in an HTML document: <!DOCTYPE html> <html> <head> <title>PHP Hello, World! program</title> </head> <body> <p><?= 'Hello, World!' ?></p> </body> </html> However, as no requirement exists for PHP code to be embedded in HTML, the simplest version of Hello, World! may be written like this, with the closing tag ?> omitted as preferred in files containing pure PHP code. <?php echo 'Hello, World!'; The PHP interpreter only executes PHP code within its delimiters. Anything outside of its delimiters is not processed by PHP, although the non-PHP text is still subject to control structures described in PHP code. The most common delimiters are <?php to open and ?> to close PHP sections. The shortened form <? also exists. This short delimiter makes script files less portable since support for them can be disabled in the local PHP configuration and it is therefore discouraged. Conversely, there is no recommendation against the echo short tag <?=. Prior to PHP 5.4.0, this short syntax for echo only works with the short_open_tag configuration setting enabled, while for PHP 5.4.0 and later it is always available. The purpose of all these delimiters is to separate PHP code from non-PHP content, such as JavaScript code or HTML markup. So the shortest Hello, World! program written in PHP is: <?='Hello, World!'; The first form of delimiters, <?php and ?>, in XHTML and other XML documents, creates correctly formed XML processing instructions. This means that the resulting mixture of PHP code and other markups in the server-side file is itself well-formed XML. Variables are prefixed with a dollar symbol, and a type does not need to be specified in advance. PHP 5 introduced type declarations that allow functions to force their parameters to be objects of a specific class, arrays, interfaces or callback functions. However, before PHP 7, type declarations could not be used with scalar types such as integers or strings. Below is an example of how PHP variables are declared and initialized. <?php $name = 'John'; // variable of string type being declared and initialized $age = 18; // variable of integer type being declared and initialized $height = 5.3; // variable of double type being declared and initialized echo $name . ' is ' . $height . m tall\\\\n; // concatenating variables and strings echo $name is $age years old.; // interpolating variables to string ?> Unlike function and class names, variable names are case-sensitive. Both double-quoted () and heredoc strings provide the ability to interpolate a variable's value into the string. PHP treats newlines as whitespace in the manner of a free-form language, and statements are terminated by a semicolon. PHP has three types of comment syntax: /* */ marks block and inline comments; // or # are used for one-line comments. The echo statement is one of several facilities PHP provides to output text.[citation needed] In terms of keywords and language syntax, PHP is similar to C-style syntax. if conditions, for and while loops and function returns are similar in syntax to languages such as C, C++, C#, Java and Perl.[citation needed]\",\n",
      "  \"data_types\": \"PHP is loosely typed. It stores integers in a platform-dependent range, either as a 32, 64 or 128-bit signed integer equivalent to the C-language long type. Unsigned integers are converted to signed values in certain situations, which is different behaviour to many other programming languages. Integer variables can be assigned using decimal (positive and negative), octal, hexadecimal, and binary notations.[citation needed] Floating-point numbers are also stored in a platform-specific range. They can be specified using floating-point notation, or two forms of scientific notation. PHP has a native Boolean type that is similar to the native Boolean types in Java and C++. Using the Boolean type conversion rules, non-zero values are interpreted as true and zero as false, as in Perl and C++. The null data type represents a variable that has no value; NULL is the only allowed value for this data type. Variables of the resource type represent references to resources from external sources. These are typically created by functions from a particular extension, and can only be processed by functions from the same extension; examples include file, image, and database resources. Arrays can contain elements of any type that PHP can handle, including resources, objects, and even other arrays. Order is preserved in lists of values and in hashes with both keys and values, and the two can be intermingled. PHP also supports strings, which can be used with single quotes, double quotes, nowdoc or heredoc syntax. The Standard PHP Library (SPL) attempts to solve standard problems and implements efficient data access interfaces and classes.\",\n",
      "  \"functions\": \"PHP defines a large array of functions in the core language and many are also available in various extensions; these functions are well documented online PHP documentation. However, the built-in library has a wide variety of naming conventions and associated inconsistencies, as described under history above. Custom functions may be defined by the developer: function myAge(int $birthYear): string { // calculate the age by subtracting the birth year from the current year. $yearsOld = date('Y') - $birthYear; // return the age in a descriptive string. return $yearsOld . ($yearsOld == 1 ? ' year' : ' years'); } echo 'I am currently ' . myAge(1995) . ' old.'; As of 2025, the output of the above sample program is I am currently 30 years old. In lieu of function pointers, functions in PHP can be referenced by a string containing their name. In this manner, normal PHP functions can be used, for example, as callbacks or within function tables. User-defined functions may be created at any time without being prototyped. Functions may be defined inside code blocks, permitting a run-time decision as to whether or not a function should be defined. There is a function_exists function that determines whether a function with a given name has already been defined. Function calls must use parentheses, with the exception of zero-argument class constructor functions called with the PHP operator new, in which case parentheses are optional.[citation needed] Since PHP 4.0.1 create_function(), a thin wrapper around eval(), allowed normal PHP functions to be created during program execution; it was deprecated in PHP 7.2 and removed in PHP 8.0 in favor of syntax for anonymous functions or closures that can capture variables from the surrounding scope, which was added in PHP 5.3. Shorthand arrow syntax was added in PHP 7.4: function getAdder($x) { return fn($y) => $x + $y; } $adder = getAdder(8); echo $adder(2); // prints 10 In the example above, getAdder() function creates a closure using passed argument $x, which takes an additional argument $y, and returns the created closure to the caller. Such a function is a first-class object, meaning that it can be stored in a variable, passed as a parameter to other functions, etc. Unusually for a dynamically typed language, PHP supports type declarations on function parameters, which are enforced at runtime. This has been supported for classes and interfaces since PHP 5.0, for arrays since PHP 5.1, for callables since PHP 5.4, and scalar (integer, float, string and boolean) types since PHP 7.0. PHP 7.0 also has type declarations for function return types, expressed by placing the type name after the list of parameters, preceded by a colon. For example, the getAdder function from the earlier example could be annotated with types like so in PHP 7: function getAdder(int $x): Closure { return fn(int $y): int => $x + $y; } $adder = getAdder(8); echo $adder(2); // prints 10 echo $adder(null); // throws an exception because an incorrect type was passed $adder = getAdder([]); // would also throw an exception By default, scalar type declarations follow weak typing principles. So, for example, if a parameter's type is int, PHP would allow not only integers, but also convertible numeric strings, floats or Booleans to be passed to that function, and would convert them. However, PHP 7 has a strict typing mode which, when used, disallows such conversions for function calls and returns within a file.\",\n",
      "  \"php_objects\": \"Basic object-oriented programming functionality was added in PHP 3 and improved in PHP 4. This allowed for PHP to gain further abstraction, making creative tasks easier for programmers using the language. Object handling was completely rewritten for PHP 5, expanding the feature set and enhancing performance. In previous versions of PHP, objects were handled like value types. The drawback of this method was that code had to make heavy use of PHP's reference variables if it wanted to modify an object it was passed rather than creating a copy of it. In the new approach, objects are referenced by handle, and not by value.[citation needed] PHP 5 introduced private and protected member variables and methods, along with abstract classes, final classes, abstract methods, and final methods. It also introduced a standard way of declaring constructors and destructors, similar to that of other object-oriented languages such as C++, and a standard exception handling model. Furthermore, PHP 5 added interfaces and allowed for multiple interfaces to be implemented. There are special interfaces that allow objects to interact with the runtime system. Objects implementing ArrayAccess can be used with array syntax and objects implementing Iterator or IteratorAggregate can be used with the foreach language construct. There is no virtual table feature in the engine, so static variables are bound with a name instead of a reference at compile time. If the developer creates a copy of an object using the reserved word clone, the Zend engine will check whether a __clone() method has been defined. If not, it will call a default __clone() which will copy the object's properties. If a __clone() method is defined, then it will be responsible for setting the necessary properties in the created object. For convenience, the engine will supply a function that imports the properties of the source object, so the programmer can start with a by-value replica of the source object and only override properties that need to be changed. The visibility of PHP properties and methods is defined using the keywords public, private, and protected. The default is public, if only var is used; var is a synonym for public. Items declared public can be accessed everywhere. protected limits access to inherited classes (and to the class that defines the item). private limits visibility only to the class that defines the item. Objects of the same type have access to each other's private and protected members even though they are not the same instance.[citation needed]\",\n",
      "  \"example\": \"The following is a basic example of object-oriented programming in PHP 8: <?php abstract class User { protected string $name; public function __construct(string $name) { // make first letter uppercase and the rest lowercase $this->name = ucfirst(strtolower($name)); } public function greet(): string { return Hello, my name is  . $this->name; } abstract public function job(): string; } class Student extends User { public function __construct(string $name, private string $course) { parent::__construct($name); } public function job(): string { return I learn  . $this->course; } } class Teacher extends User { public function __construct(string $name, private array $teachingCourses) { parent::__construct($name); } public function job(): string { return I teach  . implode(, , $this->teachingCourses); } } $students = [ new Student(Alice, Computer Science), new Student(Bob, Computer Science), new Student(Charlie, Business Studies), ]; $teachers = [ new Teacher(Dan, [Computer Science, Information Security]), new Teacher(Erin, [Computer Science, 3D Graphics Programming]), new Teacher(Frankie, [Online Marketing, Business Studies, E-commerce]), ]; foreach ([$students, $teachers] as $users) { echo $users::class . s:\\\\n; array_walk($users, function (User $user) { echo {$user->greet()}, {$user->job()}\\\\n; }); } This program outputs the following: Students: Hello, my name is Alice, I learn Computer Science Hello, my name is Bob, I learn Computer Science Hello, my name is Charlie, I learn Business Studies Teachers: Hello, my name is Dan, I teach Computer Science, Information Security Hello, my name is Erin, I teach Computer Science, 3D Graphics Programming Hello, my name is Frankie, I teach Online Marketing, Business Studies, E-commerce\",\n",
      "  \"implementations\": \"The only complete PHP implementation is the original, known simply as PHP. It is the most widely used and is powered by the Zend Engine. To disambiguate it from other implementations, it is sometimes unofficially called Zend PHP. The Zend Engine compiles PHP source code on-the-fly into an internal format that it can execute, thus it works as an interpreter. It is also the reference implementation of PHP, as PHP has no formal specification, and so the semantics of Zend PHP define the semantics of PHP. Due to the complex and nuanced semantics of PHP, defined by how Zend works, it is difficult for competing implementations to offer complete compatibility. PHP's single-request-per-script-execution model, and the fact that the Zend Engine is an interpreter, leads to inefficiency; as a result, various products have been developed to help improve PHP performance. In order to speed up execution time and not have to compile the PHP source code every time the web page is accessed, PHP scripts can also be deployed in the PHP engine's internal format by using an opcode cache, which works by caching the compiled form of a PHP script (opcodes) in shared memory to avoid the overhead of parsing and compiling the code every time the script runs. An opcode cache, Zend Opcache, is built into PHP since version 5.5. Another example of a widely used opcode cache is the Alternative PHP Cache (APC), which is available as a PECL extension. While Zend PHP is still the most popular implementation, several other implementations have been developed. Some of these are compilers or support JIT compilation, and hence offer performance benefits over Zend PHP at the expense of lacking full PHP compatibility.[citation needed] Alternative implementations include the following: HHVM (HipHop Virtual Machine) – developed at Facebook and available as open source, it converts PHP code into a high-level bytecode (commonly known as an intermediate language), which is then translated into x86-64 machine code dynamically at runtime by a just-in-time (JIT) compiler, resulting in up to 6× performance improvements. However, since version 7.2 Zend has outperformed HHVM, and HHVM 3.24 is the last version to officially support PHP. HipHop – developed at Facebook and available as open source, it transforms the PHP scripts into C++ code and then compiles the resulting code, reducing the server load up to 50%. In early 2013, Facebook deprecated it in favour of HHVM due to multiple reasons, including deployment difficulties and lack of support for the whole PHP language, including the create_function() and eval() constructs. Parrot – a virtual machine designed to run dynamic languages efficiently; the cross-translator Pipp transforms the PHP source code into the Parrot intermediate representation, which is then translated into the Parrot's bytecode and executed by the virtual machine. PeachPie – a second-generation compiler to .NET Common Intermediate Language (CIL) bytecode, built on the Roslyn platform; successor of Phalanger, sharing several architectural components Phalanger – compiles PHP into .Net Common Intermediate Language bytecode; predecessor of PeachPie Quercus – compiles PHP into Java bytecode\",\n",

You may indicate that your software works in conjunction with PHP by saying Foo for PHP instead of calling it PHP Foo or phpfoo.

      "  \"development_and_community\": \"PHP includes various free and open-source libraries in its source distribution or uses them in resulting PHP binary builds. PHP is fundamentally an Internet-aware system with built-in modules for accessing File Transfer Protocol (FTP) servers and many database servers, including PostgreSQL, MySQL, Microsoft SQL Server and SQLite (which is an embedded database), LDAP servers, and others. Numerous functions are familiar to C programmers, such as those in the stdio family, are available in standard PHP builds. PHP allows developers to write extensions in C to add functionality to the PHP language. PHP extensions can be compiled statically into PHP or loaded dynamically at runtime. Numerous extensions have been written to add support for the Windows API, process management on Unix-like operating systems, multibyte strings (Unicode), cURL, and several popular compression formats. Other PHP features made available through extensions include integration with Internet Relay Chat (IRC), dynamic generation of images and Adobe Flash content, PHP Data Objects (PDO) as an abstraction layer used for accessing databases, and even speech synthesis. Some of the language's core functions, such as those dealing with strings and arrays, are also implemented as extensions. The PHP Extension Community Library (PECL) project is a repository for extensions to the PHP language. Some other projects, such as Zephir, provide the ability for PHP extensions to be created in a high-level language and compiled into native PHP extensions. Such an approach, instead of writing PHP extensions directly in C, simplifies the development of extensions and reduces the time required for programming and testing. By December 2018 the PHP Group consisted of ten people: Thies C. Arntzen, Stig Bakken, Shane Caraveo, Andi Gutmans, Rasmus Lerdorf, Sam Ruby, Sascha Schumann, Zeev Suraski, Jim Winstead, and Andrei Zmievski.

The response to the foundation has mostly been positive, with the foundation being praised for better supporting the language and helping to stop the decrease in the language's popularity. However, it has also been criticised for adding breaking changes to minor versions of PHP, such as in PHP 8.2 where initialising members of a class out-with the original class scope would cause deprecation errors, these changes impacted a number of open source projects including WordPress.

      "  \"installation_and_configuration\": \"Example output of the phpinfo() function in PHP 7.1 There are two primary ways for adding support for PHP to a web server – as a native web server module, or as a CGI executable. PHP has a direct module interface called server application programming interface (SAPI), which is supported by many web servers including Apache HTTP Server, Microsoft IIS and iPlanet Web Server. Some other web servers, such as OmniHTTPd, support the Internet Server Application Programming Interface (ISAPI), which is Microsoft's web server module interface. If PHP has no module support for a web server, it can always be used as a Common Gateway Interface (CGI) or FastCGI processor; in that case, the web server is configured to use PHP's CGI executable to process all requests to PHP files. PHP-FPM (FastCGI Process Manager) is an alternative FastCGI implementation for PHP, bundled with the official PHP distribution since version 5.3.3. When compared to the older FastCGI implementation, it contains some additional features, mostly useful for heavily loaded web servers. When using PHP for command-line scripting, a PHP command-line interface (CLI) executable is needed. PHP supports a CLI server application programming interface (SAPI) since PHP 4.3.0. The main focus of this SAPI is developing shell applications using PHP. There are quite a few differences between the CLI SAPI and other SAPIs, although they do share many of the same behaviours. PHP has a direct module interface called SAPI for different web servers; in case of PHP 5 and Apache 2.0 on Windows, it is provided in form of a DLL file called php5apache2.dll, which is a module that, among other functions, provides an interface between PHP and the web server, implemented in a form that the server understands. This form is what is known as a SAPI.[citation needed] There are different kinds of SAPIs for various web server extensions. For example, in addition to those listed above, other SAPIs for the PHP language include the Common Gateway Interface and command-line interface. PHP can also be used for writing desktop graphical user interface (GUI) applications, by using the PHP Desktop. GitHub. or discontinued PHP-GTK extension. PHP-GTK is not included in the official PHP distribution, and as an extension, it can be used only with PHP versions 5.1.0 and newer. The most common way of installing PHP-GTK is by compiling it from the source code. When PHP is installed and used in cloud environments, software development kits (SDKs) are provided for using cloud-specific features.[citation needed] For example: Amazon Web Services provides the AWS SDK for PHP Microsoft Azure can be used with the Windows Azure SDK for PHP. Numerous configuration options are supported, affecting both core PHP features and extensions. Configuration file php.ini is searched for in different locations, depending on the way PHP is used. The configuration file is split into various sections, while some of the configuration options can be also set within the web server configuration.\",\n",
      "  \"use\": \"A broad overview of the LAMP software bundle, displayed here together with Squid PHP is a general-purpose scripting language that is especially suited to server-side web development, in which case PHP generally runs on a web server. Any PHP code in a requested file is executed by the PHP runtime, usually to create dynamic web page content or dynamic images used on websites or elsewhere. It can also be used for command-line scripting and client-side graphical user interface (GUI) applications. PHP can be deployed on most web servers, many operating systems and platforms, and can be used with many relational database management systems (RDBMS). Most web hosting providers support PHP for use by their clients. It is available free of charge, and the PHP Group provides the complete source code for users to build, customize and extend for their own use. Dynamic web page: example of server-side scripting (PHP and MySQL) Originally designed to create dynamic web pages, PHP now focuses mainly on server-side scripting, and it is similar to other server-side scripting languages that provide dynamic content from a web server to a client, such as Python, Microsoft's ASP.NET, Sun Microsystems' JavaServer Pages, and mod_perl. PHP has also attracted the development of many software frameworks that provide building blocks and a design structure to promote rapid application development (RAD).[citation needed] Some of these include PRADO, CakePHP, Symfony, CodeIgniter, Laravel, Yii Framework, Phalcon and Laminas, offering features similar to other web frameworks. The LAMP architecture has become popular in the web industry as a way of deploying web applications. PHP is commonly used as the P in this bundle alongside Linux, Apache and MySQL, although the P may also refer to Python, Perl, or some mix of the three. Similar packages, WAMP and MAMP, are also available for Windows and macOS, with the first letter standing for the respective operating system. Although both PHP and Apache are provided as part of the macOS base install, users of these packages seek a simpler installation mechanism that can be more easily kept up to date.[citation needed] For specific and more advanced usage scenarios, PHP offers a well-defined and documented way for writing custom extensions in C or C++.[non-primary source needed] Besides extending the language itself in form of additional libraries, extensions are providing a way for improving execution speed where it is critical and there is room for improvements by using a true compiled language. PHP also offers well-defined ways for embedding itself into other software projects. That way PHP can be easily used as an internal scripting language for another project, also providing tight interfacing with the project's specific internal data structures. PHP received mixed reviews due to lacking support for multithreading at the core language level, though using threads is made possible by the pthreads PECL extension. A command line interface, php-cli, and two ActiveX Windows Script Host scripting engines for PHP have been produced.[citation needed]\",\n",

Technical security flaws of the language itself or of its core libraries are not frequent (22 in 2009, about 1% of the total although PHP applies to about 20% of programs listed). Recognizing that programmers make mistakes, some languages include taint checking to automatically detect the lack of input validation which induces many issues. Such a feature has been proposed for PHP in the past, but either been rejected or the proposal abandoned. Third-party projects such as Suhosin and Snuffleupagus aim to remove or change dangerous parts of the language. Historically, old versions of PHP had some configuration parameters and default values for such runtime settings that made some PHP applications prone to security issues. Among these, magic_quotes_gpc and register_globals configuration directives were the best known; the latter made any URL parameters become PHP variables, opening a path for serious security vulnerabilities by allowing an attacker to set the value of any uninitialized global variable and interfere with the execution of a PHP script. Support for magic quotes and register globals settings has been deprecated since PHP 5.3.0, and removed from PHP 5.4.0. Another example for the potential runtime-settings vulnerability comes from failing to disable PHP execution (for example by using the engine configuration directive) for the directory where uploaded files are stored; enabling it can result in the execution of malicious code embedded within the uploaded files. The best practice is to either locate the image directory outside of the document root available to the web server and serve it via an intermediary script or disable PHP execution for the directory which stores the uploaded files.[citation needed] Also, enabling the dynamic loading of PHP extensions (via enable_dl configuration directive) in a shared web hosting environment can lead to security issues. Implied type conversions that result in different values being treated as equal, sometimes against the programmer's intent, can lead to security issues. For example, the result of the comparison '0e1234' == '0' is true, because strings that are parsable as numbers are converted to numbers; in this case, the first compared value is treated as scientific notation having the value (0×101234), which is zero. Errors like this resulted in authentication vulnerabilities in Simple Machines Forum, Typo3 and phpBB when MD5 password hashes were compared. The recommended way is to use hash_equals() (for timing attack safety), strcmp or the identity operator (===), as '0e1234' === '0' results in false.[citation needed] In a 2013 analysis of over 170,000 website defacements, published by Zone-H, the most frequently (53%) used technique was the exploitation of file inclusion vulnerability, mostly related to insecure usage of the PHP language constructs include, require, and allow_url_fopen.\",\n",
      "  \"cryptographic_security\": \"PHP includes rand() and mt_rand()functions which use a pseudorandom number generator, and are not cryptographically secure. As of version 8.1, the random_int() function is included, which uses a cryptographically secure source of randomness provided by the system. There are two attacks that can be performed over PHP entropy sources: seed attack and state recovery attack.[citation needed] As of 2012, a $250 GPU can perform up to 230 MD5 calculations per second, while a $750 GPU can perform four times as many calculations at the same time. In combination with a birthday attack this can lead to serious security vulnerabilities.[citation needed]\",\n",
      "  \"long_term_support\": \"The PHP development team provides official bug fixes for two years following release of each minor version followed by another two years where only security fixes are released. After this, the release is considered end of life and no longer officially supported. Extended long-term support beyond this is available from commercial providers, such as Zend and others\",\n",

      "  \"history\": \"TypeScript was released to the public in October 2012, with version 0.8, after two years of internal development at Microsoft. Soon after the initial public release, Miguel de Icaza praised the language itself, but criticized the lack of mature IDE support apart from Microsoft Visual Studio, which was not available on Linux and macOS at the time. As of April 2021 there is support in other IDEs and text editors, including Emacs, Vim, WebStorm, Atom and Microsoft's own Visual Studio Code. TypeScript 0.9, released in 2013, added support for generics. TypeScript 1.0 was released at Microsoft's Build developer conference in 2014. Visual Studio 2013 Update 2 provided built-in support for TypeScript. Further improvement were made in July 2014, when the development team announced a new TypeScript compiler, asserted to have a five-fold performance increase. Simultaneously, the source code, which was initially hosted on CodePlex, was moved to GitHub. On 22 September 2016, TypeScript 2.0 was released, introducing several features, including the ability for programmers to optionally enforce null safety, to mitigate what's sometimes referred to as the billion-dollar mistake. TypeScript 3.0 was released on 30 July 2018, bringing many language additions like tuples in rest parameters and spread expressions, rest parameters with tuple types, generic rest parameters and so on. TypeScript 4.0 was released on 20 August 2020. While 4.0 did not introduce any breaking changes, it added language features such as Custom JSX Factories and Variadic Tuple Types. TypeScript 5.0 was released on 16 March 2023 and included support for decorators. On March 11, 2025 Anders Hejlsberg announced on the TypeScript blog that the team is working on a Go port of the TypeScript compiler to be released as TypeScript version 7.0 later this year. It is expected to feature a 10x speedup.\",\n",
      "  \"design\": \"TypeScript originated from the shortcomings of JavaScript for the development of large-scale applications both at Microsoft and among their external customers. Challenges with dealing with complex JavaScript code led to demand for custom tooling to ease developing of components in the language. Developers sought a solution that would not break compatibility with the ECMAScript standard and its ecosystem, so a compiler was developed to transform a superset of JavaScript with type annotations and classes (TypeScript files) back into vanilla ECMAScript 5 code. TypeScript classes were based on the then-proposed ECMAScript 6 class specification to make writing prototypal inheritance less verbose and error-prone, and type annotations enabled IntelliSense and improved tooling.\",\n",
      "  \"features\": \"TypeScript adds the following syntax extensions to JavaScript: Type annotations and compile-time type checking Type inference Interfaces Enumerated types Generics Namespaces Tuples Explicit Resource Management Syntactically, TypeScript is very similar to JScript .NET, another Microsoft implementation of the ECMA-262 language standard that added support for static typing and classical object-oriented language features such as classes, inheritance, interfaces, and namespaces. Other inspirations include Java and C#.\",\n",
      "  \"type_annotations\": \"TypeScript provides static typing through type annotations to enable type checking at compile time. function add(left: number, right: number): number { return left + right; } Primitive types are annotated using all-lowercase types, such as number, boolean, bigint, and string. These types are distinct from their boxed counterparts (Number, Boolean, etc), which cannot have operations performed from values directly (a Number and number cannot be added). There are additionally undefined and null types for their respective values. All other non-primitive types are annotated using their class name, such as Error. Arrays can be written in two different ways which are both syntactically the same: the generic-based syntax Array<T> and a shorthand with T[]. Additional built-in data types are tuples, unions, never and any: An array with predefined data types at each index is a tuple, represented as [type1, type2, ..., typeN]. A variable that can hold more than one type of data is a union, represented using the logical OR | symbol (string | number). The never type is used when a given type should be impossible to create, which is useful for filtering mapped types. A value of type any supports the same operations as a value in JavaScript and minimal static type checking is performed, which makes it suitable for weakly or dynamically-typed structures. This is generally discouraged practice and should be avoided when possible. Type annotations can be exported to a separate declarations file to make type information available for TypeScript scripts using types already compiled into JavaScript. Annotations can be declared for an existing JavaScript library, as has been done for Node.js and jQuery. The TypeScript compiler makes use of type inference when types are not given. For example, the add method in the code above would be inferred as returning a number even if no return type annotation had been provided. This is based on the static types of left and right being numbers, and the compiler's knowledge that the result of adding two numbers is always a number. If no type can be inferred because of lack of declarations (such as in a JavaScript module without types), then it defaults to the dynamic any type. Additional module types can be provided using a .d.ts declaration file using the declare module moduleName syntax.\",\n",
      "  \"declaration_files\": \"When a TypeScript script gets compiled, there is an option to generate a declaration file (with the extension .d.ts) that functions as an interface to the components in the compiled JavaScript. In the process, the compiler strips away all function and method bodies and preserves only the signatures of the types that are exported. The resulting declaration file can then be used to describe the exported virtual TypeScript types of a JavaScript library or module when a third-party developer consumes it from TypeScript. The concept of declaration files is analogous to the concept of header files found in C/C++. declare namespace Arithmetics { add(left: number, right: number): number; subtract(left: number, right: number): number; multiply(left: number, right: number): number; divide(left: number, right: number): number; } Type declaration files can be written by hand for existing JavaScript libraries, as has been done for jQuery and Node.js. Large collections of declaration files for popular JavaScript libraries are hosted on GitHub in DefinitelyTyped.\",\n",
      "  \"generics\": \"Main article: Generic programming TypeScript supports generic programming using a syntax similar to Java. The following is an example of the identity function. function id<T>(x: T): T { return x; }\",\n",
      "  \"classes\": \"TypeScript uses the same annotation style for class methods and fields as for functions and variables respectively. Compared with vanilla JavaScript classes, a TypeScript class can also implement an interface through the implements keyword, use generic parameters similarly to Java, and specify public and private fields. class Person { public name: string; private age: number; private salary: number; constructor(name: string, age: number, salary: number) { this.name = name; this.age = age; this.salary = salary; } toString(): string { return `${this.name} (${this.age}) (${this.salary})`; } }\",\n",
      "  \"union_types\": \"This section is an excerpt from Union type § TypeScript.[edit] Union types are supported in TypeScript. The values are implicitly tagged with a type by the language, and may be retrieved using a typeof call for primitive values and an instanceof comparison for complex data types. Types with overlapping usage (e.g. a slice method exists on both strings and arrays, the plus operator works on both strings and numbers) don't need additional narrowing to use these features. function successor(n: number | bigint): number | bigint { // types that support the same operations don't need narrowing return ++n; } function dependsOnParameter(v: string | Array<string> | number) { // distinct types need narrowing if (v instanceof Array) { // do something } else if (typeof(v) === string) { // do something else } else { // has to be a number } }\",\n",
      "  \"enumerated_types\": \"This section is an excerpt from Enumerated type § TypeScript.[edit] TypeScript adds an 'enum' data type to JavaScript. enum Cardsuit {Clubs, Diamonds, Hearts, Spades}; var c: Cardsuit = Cardsuit.Diamonds; By default, enums number members starting at 0; this can be overridden by setting the value of the first: enum Cardsuit {Clubs = 1, Diamonds, Hearts, Spades}; var c: Cardsuit = Cardsuit.Diamonds; All the values can be set: enum Cardsuit {Clubs = 1, Diamonds = 2, Hearts = 4, Spades = 8}; var c: Cardsuit = Cardsuit.Diamonds; TypeScript supports mapping the numeric value to its name. For example, this finds the name of the value 2: enum Cardsuit {Clubs = 1, Diamonds, Hearts, Spades}; var suitName: string = Cardsuit; alert(suitName);\",\n",
      "  \"modules_and_namespaces\": \"TypeScript distinguishes between modules and namespaces. Both features in TypeScript support encapsulation of classes, interfaces, functions and variables into containers. Namespaces (formerly internal modules) use JavaScript immediately-invoked function expressions to encapsulate code, whereas modules (formerly external modules) use existing JavaScript library patterns (CommonJS or ES Modules).\",\n",
      "  \"compatibility_with_javascript\": \"Main article: JavaScript As TypeScript is simply a superset of JavaScript, existing JavaScript can be quickly adapted to TypeScript and TypeScript program can seamlessly consume JavaScript. The compiler can target all ECMAScript versions 5 and above, transpiling modern features like classes and arrow functions to their older counterparts. With TypeScript, it is possible to use existing JavaScript code, incorporate popular JavaScript libraries, and call TypeScript-generated code from other JavaScript. Type declarations for these libraries are usually provided with the source code but can be declared or installed separately if needed.\",\n",
      "  \"compiler\": \"The TypeScript compiler, named tsc, is written in TypeScript. As a result, it can be compiled into regular JavaScript and can then be executed in any JavaScript engine (e.g. a browser). The compiler package comes bundled with a script host that can execute the compiler. It is also available as a Node.js package that uses Node.js as a host. The compiler can target a particular edition of ECMAScript (such as ES5 for legacy browser compatibility), but by default compiles for the latest standards.\",\n",

Visual Studio Code supports TypeScript in addition to several other languages, and offers features like debugging and intelligent code completion. alm.tools is an open source cloud IDE for TypeScript built using TypeScript, ReactJS and TypeStyle. JetBrains supports TypeScript with code completion, refactoring and debugging in its IDEs built on IntelliJ platform, such as PhpStorm 6, WebStorm 6, and IntelliJ IDEA, as well as their Visual Studio Add-in and extension, ReSharper 8.1.

ESLint, a standard JavaScript linter, also provided some support for TypeScript via community plugins. However, ESLint's inability to leverage TypeScript's language services precluded certain forms of semantic linting and program-wide analysis. In early 2019, the TSLint team announced the linter's deprecation in favor of typescript-eslint, a joint effort of the TSLint, ESLint and TypeScript teams to consolidate linting under the ESLint umbrella for improved performance, community unity and developer accessibility.\",\n",

      "  \"history\": \"Lua was created in 1993 by Roberto Ierusalimschy, Luiz Henrique de Figueiredo and Waldemar Celes, members of the Computer Graphics Technology Group (Tecgraf) at the Pontifical Catholic University of Rio de Janeiro, in Brazil. From 1977 until 1992, Brazil had a policy of strong trade barriers (called a market reserve) for computer hardware and software, believing that Brazil could and should produce its own hardware and software. In that climate, Tecgraf's clients could not afford, either politically or financially, to buy customized software from abroad; under the market reserve, clients would have to go through a complex bureaucratic process to prove their needs couldn't be met by Brazilian companies. Those reasons led Tecgraf to implement the basic tools it needed from scratch. Lua's predecessors were the data-description/configuration languages Simple Object Language (SOL) and data-entry language (DEL). They had been independently developed at Tecgraf in 1992–1993 to add some flexibility into two different projects (both were interactive graphical programs for engineering applications at Petrobras company). There was a lack of any flow-control structures in SOL and DEL, and Petrobras felt a growing need to add full programming power to them. In The Evolution of Lua, the language's authors wrote: In 1993, the only real contender was Tcl, which had been explicitly designed to be embedded into applications. However, Tcl had unfamiliar syntax, did not offer good support for data description, and ran only on Unix platforms. We did not consider LISP or Scheme because of their unfriendly syntax. Python was still in its infancy. In the free, do-it-yourself atmosphere that then reigned in Tecgraf, it was quite natural that we should try to develop our own scripting language ... Because many potential users of the language were not professional programmers, the language should avoid cryptic syntax and semantics. The implementation of the new language should be highly portable, because Tecgraf's clients had a very diverse collection of computer platforms. Finally, since we expected that other Tecgraf products would also need to embed a scripting language, the new language should follow the example of SOL and be provided as a library with a C API. Lua 1.0 was designed in such a way that its object constructors, being then slightly different from the current light and flexible style, incorporated the data-description syntax of SOL (hence the name Lua: Sol meaning Sun in Portuguese, and Lua meaning Moon). Lua syntax for control structures was mostly borrowed from Modula (if, while, repeat/until), but also had taken influence from CLU (multiple assignments and multiple returns from function calls, as a simpler alternative to reference parameters or explicit pointers), C++ (neat idea of allowing a local variable to be declared only where we need it), SNOBOL and AWK (associative arrays). In an article published in Dr. Dobb's Journal, Lua's creators also state that LISP and Scheme with their single, ubiquitous data-structure mechanism (the list) were a major influence on their decision to develop the table as the primary data structure of Lua. Lua semantics have been increasingly influenced by Scheme over time, especially with the introduction of anonymous functions and full lexical scoping. Several features were added in new Lua versions. Versions of Lua prior to version 5.0 were released under a license similar to the BSD license. From version 5.0 onwards, Lua has been licensed under the MIT License. Both are permissive free software licences and are almost identical.\",\n",
      "  \"features\": \"Lua is commonly described as a multi-paradigm language, providing a small set of general features that can be extended to fit different problem types. Lua does not contain explicit support for inheritance, but allows it to be implemented with metatables. Similarly, Lua allows programmers to implement namespaces, classes and other related features using its single table implementation; first-class functions allow the employment of many techniques from functional programming and full lexical scoping allows fine-grained information hiding to enforce the principle of least privilege. In general, Lua strives to provide simple, flexible meta-features that can be extended as needed, rather than supply a feature-set specific to one programming paradigm. As a result, the base language is light; the full reference interpreter is only about 247 kB compiled and easily adaptable to a broad range of applications. As a dynamically typed language intended for use as an extension language or scripting language, Lua is compact enough to fit on a variety of host platforms. It supports only a small number of atomic data structures such as Boolean values, numbers (double-precision floating point and 64-bit integers by default) and strings. Typical data structures such as arrays, sets, lists and records can be represented using Lua's single native data structure, the table, which is essentially a heterogeneous associative array. Lua implements a small set of advanced features such as first-class functions, garbage collection, closures, proper tail calls, coercion (automatic conversion between string and number values at run time), coroutines (cooperative multitasking) and dynamic module loading.\",\n",

Multi-line strings and comments are marked with double square brackets. -- Single line comment --[[ Multi-line comment --]] The factorial function is implemented in this example: function factorial(n) local x = 1 for i = 2, n do x = x * i end return x end\",\n",
      "  \"control_flow\": \"Lua has one type of conditional test: if then end with optional else and elseif then execution control constructs. The generic if then end statement requires all three keywords: if condition then --statement body end An example of an if statement if x ~= 10 then print(x) end The else keyword may be added with an accompanying statement block to control execution when the if condition evaluates to false: if condition then --statement body else --statement body end An example of an if else statement if x == 10 then print(10) else print(x) end Execution may also be controlled according to multiple conditions using the elseif then keywords: if condition then --statement body elseif condition then --statement body else -- optional --optional default statement body end An example of an if elseif else statement if x == y then print(x = y) elseif x == z then print(x = z) else -- optional print(x does not equal any other variable) end Lua has four types of conditional loops: the while loop, the repeat loop (similar to a do while loop), the numeric for loop and the generic for loop. --condition = true while condition do --statements end repeat --statements until condition for i = first, last, delta do --delta may be negative, allowing the for loop to count down or up --statements --example: print(i) end This generic for loop would iterate over the table _G using the standard iterator function pairs, until it returns nil: for key, value in pairs(_G) do print(key, value) end Loops can also be nested (put inside of another loop). local grid = { { 11, 12, 13 }, { 21, 22, 23 }, { 31, 32, 33 } } for y, row in pairs(grid) do for x, value in pairs(row) do print(x, y, value) end end\",\n",
      "  \"functions\": \"Lua's treatment of functions as first-class values is shown in the following example, where the print function's behavior is modified: do local oldprint = print -- Store current print function as oldprint function print(s) --[[ Redefine print function. The usual print function can still be used through oldprint. The new one has only one argument.]] oldprint(s == foo and bar or s) end end Any future calls to print will now be routed through the new function, and because of Lua's lexical scoping, the old print function will only be accessible by the new, modified print. Lua also supports closures, as demonstrated below: function addto(x) -- Return a new function that adds x to the argument return function(y) --[[ When we refer to the variable x, which is outside the current scope and whose lifetime would be shorter than that of this anonymous function, Lua creates a closure.]] return x + y end end fourplus = addto(4) print(fourplus(3)) -- Prints 7 --This can also be achieved by calling the function in the following way: print(addto(4)(3)) --[[ This is because we are calling the returned function from 'addto(4)' with the argument '3' directly. This also helps to reduce data cost and up performance if being called iteratively.]] A new closure for the variable x is created every time addto is called, so that each new anonymous function returned will always access its own x parameter. The closure is managed by Lua's garbage collector, just like any other object.\",\n",
      "  \"tables\": \"Tables are the most important data structures (and, by design, the only built-in composite data type) in Lua and are the foundation of all user-created types. They are associative arrays with addition of automatic numeric key and special syntax. A table is a set of key and data pairs, where the data is referenced by key; in other words, it is a hashed heterogeneous associative array. Tables are created using the {} constructor syntax. a_table = {} -- Creates a new, empty table Tables are always passed by reference (see Call by sharing). A key (index) can be any value except nil and NaN, including functions. a_table = {x = 10} -- Creates a new table, with one entry mapping x to the number 10. print(a_table[x]) -- Prints the value associated with the string key, in this case 10. b_table = a_table b_table[x] = 20 -- The value in the table has been changed to 20. print(b_table[x]) -- Prints 20. print(a_table[x]) -- Also prints 20, because a_table and b_table both refer to the same table. A table is often used as structure (or record) by using strings as keys. Because such use is very common, Lua features a special syntax for accessing such fields. point = { x = 10, y = 20 } -- Create new table print(point[x]) -- Prints 10 print(point.x) -- Has exactly the same meaning as line above. The easier-to-read dot notation is just syntactic sugar. By using a table to store related functions, it can act as a namespace. Point = {} Point.new = function(x, y) return {x = x, y = y} -- return {[x] = x, [y] = y} end Point.set_x = function(point, x) point.x = x -- point[x] = x; end Tables are automatically assigned a numerical key, enabling them to be used as an array data type. The first automatic index is 1 rather than 0 as it is for many other programming languages (though an explicit index of 0 is allowed). A numeric key 1 is distinct from a string key 1. array = { a, b, c, d } -- Indices are assigned automatically. print(array) -- Prints b. Automatic indexing in Lua starts at 1. print(#array) -- Prints 4. # is the length operator for tables and strings. array = z -- Zero is a legal index. print(#array) -- Still prints 4, as Lua arrays are 1-based. The length of a table t is defined to be any integer index n such that t[n] is not nil and t[n+1] is nil; moreover, if t is nil, n can be zero. For a regular array, with non-nil values from 1 to a given n, its length is exactly that n, the index of its last value. If the array has holes (that is, nil values between other non-nil values), then #t can be any of the indices that directly precedes a nil value (that is, it may consider any such nil value as the end of the array). ExampleTable = { {1, 2, 3, 4}, {5, 6, 7, 8} } print(ExampleTable) -- Prints 3 print(ExampleTable) -- Prints 8 A table can be an array of objects. function Point(x, y) -- Point object constructor return { x = x, y = y } -- Creates and returns a new object (table) end array = { Point(10, 20), Point(30, 40), Point(50, 60) } -- Creates array of points -- array = { { x = 10, y = 20 }, { x = 30, y = 40 }, { x = 50, y = 60 } }; print(array.y) -- Prints 40 Using a hash map to emulate an array is normally slower than using an actual array; however, Lua tables are optimized for use as arrays to help avoid this issue.\",\n",
      "  \"metatables\": \"Extensible semantics is a key feature of Lua, and the metatable concept allows powerful customization of tables. The following example demonstrates an infinite table. For any n, fibs[n] will give the n-th Fibonacci number using dynamic programming and memoization. fibs = { 1, 1 } -- Initial values for fibs and fibs. setmetatable(fibs, { __index = function(values, n) --[[__index is a function predefined by Lua, it is called if key n does not exist.]] values[n] = values[n - 1] + values[n - 2] -- Calculate and memoize fibs[n]. return values[n] end })\",\n",
      "  \"object_oriented_programming\": \"Although Lua does not have a built-in concept of classes, object-oriented programming can be emulated using functions and tables. An object is formed by putting methods and fields in a table. Inheritance (both single and multiple) can be implemented with metatables, delegating nonexistent methods and fields to a parent object. There is no such concept as class with these techniques; rather, prototypes are used, similar to Self or JavaScript. New objects are created either with a factory method (that constructs new objects from scratch) or by cloning an existing object. Creating a basic vector object: local Vector = {} local VectorMeta = { __index = Vector} function Vector.new(x, y, z) -- The constructor return setmetatable({x = x, y = y, z = z}, VectorMeta) end function Vector.magnitude(self) -- Another method return math.sqrt(self.x^2 + self.y^2 + self.z^2) end local vec = Vector.new(0, 1, 0) -- Create a vector print(vec.magnitude(vec)) -- Call a method (output: 1) print(vec.x) -- Access a member variable (output: 0) Here, setmetatable tells Lua to look for an element in the Vector table if it is not present in the vec table. vec.magnitude, which is equivalent to vec[magnitude], first looks in the vec table for the magnitude element. The vec table does not have a magnitude element, but its metatable delegates to the Vector table for the magnitude element when it's not found in the vec table. Lua provides some syntactic sugar to facilitate object orientation. To declare member functions inside a prototype table, one can use function table:func(args), which is equivalent to function table.func(self, args). Calling class methods also makes use of the colon: object:func(args) is equivalent to object.func(object, args). That in mind, here is a corresponding class with : syntactic sugar: local Vector = {} Vector.__index = Vector function Vector:new(x, y, z) -- The constructor -- Since the function definition uses a colon, -- its first argument is self which refers -- to Vector return setmetatable({x = x, y = y, z = z}, self) end function Vector:magnitude() -- Another method -- Reference the implicit object using self return math.sqrt(self.x^2 + self.y^2 + self.z^2) end local vec = Vector:new(0, 1, 0) -- Create a vector print(vec:magnitude()) -- Call a method (output: 1) print(vec.x) -- Access a member variable (output: 0)\",\n",
      "  \"inheritance\": \"Lua supports using metatables to give Lua class inheritance. In this example, we allow vectors to have their values multiplied by a constant in a derived class. local Vector = {} Vector.__index = Vector function Vector:new(x, y, z) -- The constructor -- Here, self refers to whatever class's new -- method we call. In a derived class, self will -- be the derived class; in the Vector class, self -- will be Vector return setmetatable({x = x, y = y, z = z}, self) end function Vector:magnitude() -- Another method -- Reference the implicit object using self return math.sqrt(self.x^2 + self.y^2 + self.z^2) end -- Example of class inheritance local VectorMult = {} VectorMult.__index = VectorMult setmetatable(VectorMult, Vector) -- Make VectorMult a child of Vector function VectorMult:multiply(value) self.x = self.x * value self.y = self.y * value self.z = self.z * value return self end local vec = VectorMult:new(0, 1, 0) -- Create a vector print(vec:magnitude()) -- Call a method (output: 1) print(vec.y) -- Access a member variable (output: 1) vec:multiply(2) -- Multiply all components of vector by 2 print(vec.y) -- Access member again (output: 2) Lua also supports multiple inheritance; __index can either be a function or a table. Operator overloading can also be done; Lua metatables can have elements such as __add, __sub and so on.\",\n",
      "  \"implementation\": \"Lua programs are not interpreted directly from the textual Lua file, but are compiled into bytecode, which is then run on the Lua virtual machine (VM). The compiling process is typically invisible to the user and is performed during run-time, especially when a just-in-time compilation (JIT) compiler is used, but it can be done offline to increase loading performance or reduce the memory footprint of the host environment by leaving out the compiler. Lua bytecode can also be produced and executed from within Lua, using the dump function from the string library and the load/loadstring/loadfile functions. Lua version 5.3.4 is implemented in approximately 24,000 lines of C code. Like most CPUs, and unlike most virtual machines (which are stack-based), the Lua VM is register-based, and therefore more closely resembles most hardware design. The register architecture both avoids excessive copying of values, and reduces the total number of instructions per function. The virtual machine of Lua 5 is one of the first register-based pure VMs to have a wide use. Parrot and Android's Dalvik are two other well-known register-based VMs. PCScheme's VM was also register-based. This example is the bytecode listing of the factorial function defined above (as shown by the luac 5.1 compiler): function <factorial.lua:1,7> (9 instructions, 36 bytes at 0x8063c60) 1 param, 6 slots, 0 upvalues, 6 locals, 2 constants, 0 functions 1 LOADK 1 -1 ; 1 2 LOADK 2 -2 ; 2 3 MOVE 3 0 4 LOADK 4 -1 ; 1 5 FORPREP 2 1 ; to 7 6 MUL 1 1 5 7 FORLOOP 2 -2 ; to 6 8 RETURN 1 2 9 RETURN 0 1\",\n",
      "  \"c_api\": \"Lua is intended to be embedded into other applications, and provides a C API for this purpose. The API is divided into two parts: the Lua core and the Lua auxiliary library. The Lua API's design eliminates the need for manual reference counting (management) in C code, unlike Python's API. The API, like the language, is minimalist. Advanced functions are provided by the auxiliary library, which consists largely of preprocessor macros which assist with complex table operations. The Lua C API is stack based. Lua provides functions to push and pop most simple C data types (integers, floats, etc.) to and from the stack, and functions to manipulate tables through the stack. The Lua stack is somewhat different from a traditional stack; the stack can be indexed directly, for example. Negative indices indicate offsets from the top of the stack. For example, −1 is the top (most recently pushed value), while positive indices indicate offsets from the bottom (oldest value). Marshalling data between C and Lua functions is also done using the stack. To call a Lua function, arguments are pushed onto the stack, and then the lua_call is used to call the actual function. When writing a C function to be directly called from Lua, the arguments are read from the stack. Here is an example of calling a Lua function from C: #include <stdio.h> #include <lua.h> // Lua main library (lua_*) #include <lauxlib.h> // Lua auxiliary library (luaL_*) int main(void) { // create a Lua state lua_State *L = luaL_newstate(); // load and execute a string if (luaL_dostring(L, function foo (x,y) return x+y end)) { lua_close(L); return -1; } // push value of global foo (the function defined above) // to the stack, followed by integers 5 and 3 lua_getglobal(L, foo); lua_pushinteger(L, 5); lua_pushinteger(L, 3); lua_call(L, 2, 1); // call a function with two arguments and one return value printf(Result: %d\\\\n, lua_tointeger(L, -1)); // print integer value of item at stack top lua_pop(L, 1); // return stack to original state lua_close(L); // close Lua state return 0; } Running this example gives: $ cc -o example example.c -llua $ ./example Result: 8 The C API also provides some special tables, located at various pseudo-indices in the Lua stack. At LUA_GLOBALSINDEX prior to Lua 5.2 is the globals table, _G from within Lua, which is the main namespace. There is also a registry located at LUA_REGISTRYINDEX where C programs can store Lua values for later retrieval.\",\n",
      "  \"modules\": \"Besides standard library (core) modules it is possible to write extensions using the Lua API. Extension modules are shared objects which can be used to extend the functions of the interpreter by providing native facilities to Lua scripts. Lua scripts may load extension modules using require, just like modules written in Lua itself, or with package.loadlib. When a C library is loaded via require('foo') Lua will look for the function luaopen_foo and call it, which acts as any C function callable from Lua and generally returns a table filled with methods. A growing set of modules termed rocks are available through a package management system named LuaRocks, in the spirit of CPAN, RubyGems and Python eggs. Prewritten Lua bindings exist for most popular programming languages, including other scripting languages. For C++, there are a number of template-based approaches and some automatic binding generators.\",\n",

Some games that do not natively support Lua programming or scripting, have this function added by mods, as ComputerCraft does for Minecraft. Also, Lua is used in non-video game software, such as Adobe Lightroom, Moho, iClone, Aerospike, and some system software in FreeBSD and NetBSD, and used as a template scripting language on MediaWiki using the Scribunto extension. In 2003, a poll conducted by GameDev.net showed Lua was the most popular scripting language for game programming. On 12 January 2012, Lua was announced as a winner of the Front Line Award 2011 from the magazine Game Developer in the category Programming Tools. Many non-game applications also use Lua for extensibility, such as LuaTeX, an implementation of the TeX type-setting language, Redis, a key-value database, ScyllaDB, a wide-column store, Neovim, a text editor, Nginx, a web server, Wireshark, a network packet analyzer and Pure Data, a visual audio programming language (through the pdlua extension). Through the Scribunto extension, Lua is available as a server-side scripting language in the MediaWiki software that runs Wikipedia and other wikis. Among its uses are allowing the integration of data from Wikidata into articles, and powering the automated taxobox system.\",\n",

      "  \"history\": \"Bjarne Stroustrup, the creator of C++, in his AT&T New Jersey office, c. 2000 In 1979, Bjarne Stroustrup, a Danish computer scientist, began work on C with Classes, the predecessor to C++. The motivation for creating a new language originated from Stroustrup's experience in programming for his PhD thesis. Stroustrup found that Simula had features that were very helpful for large software development, but the language was too slow for practical use, while BCPL was fast but too low-level to be suitable for large software development. When Stroustrup started working in AT&T Bell Labs, he had the problem of analyzing the UNIX kernel with respect to distributed computing. Remembering his PhD experience, Stroustrup set out to enhance the C language with Simula-like features. C was chosen because it was general-purpose, fast, portable, and widely used. In addition to C and Simula's influences, other languages influenced this new language, including ALGOL 68, Ada, CLU, and ML.[citation needed] Initially, Stroustrup's C with Classes added features to the C compiler, Cpre, including classes, derived classes, strong typing, inlining, and default arguments. A quiz on C++11 features being given in Paris in 2015 In 1982, Stroustrup started to develop a successor to C with Classes, which he named C++ (++ being the increment operator in C) after going through several other names. New features were added, including virtual functions, function name and operator overloading, references, constants, type-safe free-store memory allocation (new/delete), improved type checking, and BCPL-style single-line comments with two forward slashes (//). Furthermore, Stroustrup developed a new, standalone compiler for C++, Cfront. In 1984, Stroustrup implemented the first stream input/output library. The idea of providing an output operator rather than a named output function was suggested by Doug McIlroy (who had previously suggested Unix pipes). In 1985, the first edition of The C++ Programming Language was released, which became the definitive reference for the language, as there was not yet an official standard. The first commercial implementation of C++ was released in October of the same year. In 1989, C++ 2.0 was released, followed by the updated second edition of The C++ Programming Language in 1991. New features in 2.0 included multiple inheritance, abstract classes, static member functions, const member functions, and protected members. In 1990, The Annotated C++ Reference Manual was published. This work became the basis for the future standard. Later feature additions included templates, exceptions, namespaces, new casts, and a Boolean type. In 1998, C++98 was released, standardizing the language, and a minor update (C++03) was released in 2003. After C++98, C++ evolved relatively slowly until, in 2011, the C++11 standard was released, adding numerous new features, enlarging the standard library further, and providing more facilities to C++ programmers. After a minor C++14 update released in December 2014, various new additions were introduced in C++17. After becoming finalized in February 2020, a draft of the C++20 standard was approved on 4 September 2020, and officially published on 15 December 2020. On January 3, 2018, Stroustrup was announced as the 2018 winner of the Charles Stark Draper Prize for Engineering, for conceptualizing and developing the C++ programming language. In December 2022, C++ ranked third on the TIOBE index, surpassing Java for the first time in the history of the index. As of November 2024[update], the language ranks second after Python, with Java being in third.\",\n",
      "  \"etymology\": \"According to Stroustrup, the name signifies the evolutionary nature of the changes from C. This name is credited to Rick Mascitti (mid-1983) and was first used in December 1983. When Mascitti was questioned informally in 1992 about the naming, he indicated that it was given in a tongue-in-cheek spirit. The name comes from C's ++ operator (which increments the value of a variable) and a common naming convention of using + to indicate an enhanced computer program. During C++'s development period, the language had been referred to as new C and C with Classes before acquiring its final name.\",\n",
      "  \"philosophy\": \"Throughout C++'s life, its development and evolution has been guided by a set of principles: It must be driven by actual problems and its features should be immediately useful in real world programs. Every feature should be implementable (with a reasonably obvious way to do so). Programmers should be free to pick their own programming style, and that style should be fully supported by C++. Allowing a useful feature is more important than preventing every possible misuse of C++. It should provide facilities for organizing programs into separate, well-defined parts, and provide facilities for combining separately developed parts. No implicit violations of the type system (but allow explicit violations; that is, those explicitly requested by the programmer). User-created types need to have the same support and performance as built-in types. Unused features should not negatively impact created executables (e.g. in lower performance). There should be no language beneath C++ (except assembly language). C++ should work alongside other existing programming languages, rather than fostering its own separate and incompatible programming environment. If the programmer's intent is unknown, allow the programmer to specify it by providing manual control.\",\n",

So far, it has published seven revisions of the C++ standard and is currently working on the next revision, C++26. Scene during the C++ standards committee meeting in Stockholm in 1996 In 1998, the ISO working group standardized C++ for the first time as ISO/IEC 14882:1998, which is informally known as C++98. In 2003, it published a new version of the C++ standard called ISO/IEC 14882:2003, which fixed problems identified in C++98. The next major revision of the standard was informally referred to as C++0x, but it was not released until 2011. C++11 (14882:2011) included many additions to both the core language and the standard library. In 2014, C++14 (also known as C++1y) was released as a small extension to C++11, featuring mainly bug fixes and small improvements. The Draft International Standard ballot procedures completed in mid-August 2014. After C++14, a major revision C++17, informally known as C++1z, was completed by the ISO C++ committee in mid July 2017 and was approved and published in December 2017. As part of the standardization process, ISO also publishes technical reports and specifications: ISO/IEC TR 18015:2006 on the use of C++ in embedded systems and on performance implications of C++ language and library features, ISO/IEC TR 19768:2007 (also known as the C++ Technical Report 1) on library extensions mostly integrated into C++11, ISO/IEC TR 29124:2010 on special mathematical functions, integrated into C++17, ISO/IEC TR 24733:2011 on decimal floating-point arithmetic, ISO/IEC TS 18822:2015 on the standard filesystem library, integrated into C++17, ISO/IEC TS 19570:2015 on parallel versions of the standard library algorithms, integrated into C++17, ISO/IEC TS 19841:2015 on software transactional memory, ISO/IEC TS 19568:2015 on a new set of library extensions, some of which are already integrated into C++17, ISO/IEC TS 19217:2015 on the C++ concepts, integrated into C++20, ISO/IEC TS 19571:2016 on the library extensions for concurrency, some of which are already integrated into C++20, ISO/IEC TS 19568:2017 on a new set of general-purpose library extensions, ISO/IEC TS 21425:2017 on the library extensions for ranges, integrated into C++20, ISO/IEC TS 22277:2017 on coroutines, integrated into C++20, ISO/IEC TS 19216:2018 on the networking library, ISO/IEC TS 21544:2018 on modules, integrated into C++20, ISO/IEC TS 19570:2018 on a new set of library extensions for parallelism ISO/IEC TS 23619:2021 on new extensions for reflective programming (reflection), ISO/IEC TS 9922:2024 on new set of concurrency extensions, and ISO/IEC TS 19568:2024 on another new set of library extensions. More technical specifications are in development and pending approval.\",\n",
      "  \"language\": \"Main article: C++ syntax The C++ language has two main components: a direct mapping of hardware features provided primarily by the C subset, and zero-overhead abstractions based on those mappings. Stroustrup describes C++ as a light-weight abstraction programming language [designed] for building and using efficient and elegant abstractions; and offering both hardware access and abstraction is the basis of C++. Doing it efficiently is what distinguishes it from other languages. C++ inherits most of C's syntax. A hello world program that conforms to the C standard is also a valid C++ hello world program. The following is Bjarne Stroustrup's version of the Hello world program that uses the C++ Standard Library stream facility to write a message to standard output:[note 2] #include <iostream> int main() { std::cout << Hello, world!\\\\n; }\",\n",
      "  \"standard_library\": \"The draft Working Paper standard that became approved as C++98; half of its size was devoted to the C++ Standard Library. Main article: C++ Standard Library The C++ standard consists of two parts: the core language and the standard library. C++ programmers expect the latter on every major implementation of C++; it includes aggregate types (vectors, lists, maps, sets, queues, stacks, arrays, tuples), algorithms (find, for_each, binary_search, random_shuffle, etc.), input/output facilities (iostream, for reading from and writing to the console and files), filesystem library, localisation support, smart pointers for automatic memory management, regular expression support, multi-threading library, atomics support (allowing a variable to be read or written to by at most one thread at a time without any external synchronisation), time utilities (measurement, getting current time, etc.), a system for converting error reporting that does not use C++ exceptions into C++ exceptions, a random number generator, and a slightly modified version of the C standard library (to make it comply with the C++ type system). A large part of the C++ library is based on the Standard Template Library (STL). Useful tools provided by the STL include containers as the collections of objects (such as vectors and lists), iterators that provide array-like access to containers, and algorithms that perform operations such as searching and sorting. Furthermore, (multi)maps (associative arrays) and (multi)sets are provided, all of which export compatible interfaces. Therefore, using templates it is possible to write generic algorithms that work with any container or on any sequence defined by iterators. As in C, the features of the library may be accessed by using the #include directive to include a standard header. The C++ Standard Library provides 105 standard headers, of which 27 are deprecated. With the introduction of modules in C++20, these headers may be accessed with import, and in C++23, the entire standard library can now be directly imported as module itself, with import std;. Currently, the C++ standard library provides two modules, std and std.compat (a compatibility module for std which exports C standard library facilities into the global namespace). The standard incorporates the STL that was originally designed by Alexander Stepanov, who experimented with generic algorithms and containers for many years. When he started with C++, he finally found a language where it was possible to create generic algorithms (e.g., STL sort) that perform even better than, for example, the C standard library qsort, thanks to C++ features like using inlining and compile-time binding instead of function pointers. The standard does not refer to it as STL, as it is merely a part of the standard library, but the term is still widely used to distinguish it from the rest of the standard library (input/output streams, internationalization, diagnostics, the C library subset, etc.). Most C++ compilers, and all major ones, provide a standards-conforming implementation of the C++ standard library.\",\n",
      "  \"c_core_guidelines\": \"The C++ Core Guidelines are an initiative led by Bjarne Stroustrup, the inventor of C++, and Herb Sutter, the convener and chair of the C++ ISO Working Group, to help programmers write 'Modern C++' by using best practices for the language standards C++11 and newer, and to help developers of compilers and static checking tools to create rules for catching bad programming practices. The main aim is to efficiently and consistently write type and resource safe C++. The Core Guidelines were announced in the opening keynote at CPPCon 2015. The Guidelines are accompanied by the Guideline Support Library (GSL), a header only library of types and functions to implement the Core Guidelines and static checker tools for enforcing Guideline rules.\",\n",
      "  \"compatibility\": \"To give compiler vendors greater freedom, the C++ standards committee decided not to dictate the implementation of name mangling, exception handling, and other implementation-specific features. The downside of this decision is that object code produced by different compilers is expected to be incompatible. There are, however, attempts to standardize compilers for particular machines or operating systems. For example, the Itanium C++ ABI is processor-independent (despite its name) and is implemented by GCC and Clang.\",\n",
      "  \"with_c\": \"Main article: Compatibility of C and C++ C++ is often considered to be a superset of C but this is not strictly true. Most C code can easily be made to compile correctly in C++ but there are a few differences that cause some valid C code to be invalid or behave differently in C++. For example, C allows implicit conversion from void* to other pointer types but C++ does not (for type safety reasons). Also, C++ defines many new keywords, such as new and class, which may be used as identifiers (for example, variable names) in a C program. Some incompatibilities have been removed by the 1999 revision of the C standard (C99), which now supports C++ features such as line comments (//) and declarations mixed with code. On the other hand, C99 introduced a number of new features that C++ did not support that were incompatible or redundant in C++, such as variable-length arrays, native complex-number types (however, the std::complex class in the C++ standard library provides similar functionality, although not code-compatible), designated initializers, compound literals, and the restrict keyword. Some of the C99-introduced features were included in the subsequent version of the C++ standard, C++11 (out of those which were not redundant). However, the C++11 standard introduces new incompatibilities, such as disallowing assignment of a string literal to a character pointer, which remains valid C. To intermix C and C++ code, any function declaration or definition that is to be called from/used both in C and C++ must be declared with C linkage by placing it within an extern C {/*...*/} block. Such a function may not rely on features depending on name mangling (i.e., function overloading).\",\n",
      "  \"inline_assembly\": \"Programs developed in C or C++ often utilize inline assembly to take advantage of its low-level functionalities, greater speed, and enhanced control compared to high-level programming languages when optimizing for performance is essential. C++ provides support for embedding assembly language using asm declarations, but the compatibility of inline assembly varies significantly between compilers and architectures. Unlike high-level language features such as Python or Java, assembly code is highly dependent on the underlying processor and compiler implementation.\",\n",
      "  \"variations_across_compilers\": \"Different C++ compilers implement inline assembly in distinct ways. GCC (GNU Compiler Collection) and Clang: Use the GCC extended inline assembly syntax. Using __asm__ keyword instead of asm when writing code that can be compiled with -ansi and -std options, which allows specifying input/output operands and clobbered registers. This approach is widely adopted, including by Intel and IBM compilers. MSVC (Microsoft Visual C++): The inline assembler is built into the compiler. Previously supported inline assembly via the __asm keyword, but this support has been removed in 64-bit mode, requiring separate .asm modules instead. TI ARM Clang and Embedded Compilers: Some embedded system compilers, like Texas Instruments' TI Arm Clang, allow inline assembly but impose stricter rules to avoid conflicts with register conventions and calling conventions.\",\n",
      "  \"interoperability_between_c_and_assembly\": \"C++ provides two primary methods of integrating ASM code. 1. Standalone assembly files – Assembly code is written separately and linked with C++ code. 2. Inline assembly – Assembly code is embedded within C++ code using compiler-specific extensions. Example Code for ASM Compatibility When calling an assembly function from C++, use extern C to prevent C++ name mangling. //main.cpp import std; extern C int add_asm(int, int); // Declare the assembly function int main() { int result = add_asm(5, 7); std::println(Result from ASM: {}, result); return 0; } #asm code using RISC-V architecture .section .text .global add_asm add_asm: add a0, a0, a1 # Add first argument (a0) and second argument (a1), store in a0 ret # Return (a0 holds return value) Global variables in assembly must be declared as extern in C++ and marked .global in assembly. // main.cpp import std; extern C int global_var; // Declare global variable from assembly int main() { std::println(Global variable from ASM: {}, global_var); return 0; } #asm using RISC-V architecture .section .data .global global_var .align 4 global_var: .word 42 # Define integer value Inline assembly allows embedding ASM directly in C++ using the asm keyword. //main.cpp (using GCC/CLANG compiler) import std; int main() { int x = 10, y = 20, sum; asm volatile ( add %0, %1, %2 : =r (sum) // Output operand (stored in a register) : r (x), r (y) // Input operands (stored in registers) ); std::println(Sum using inline ASM: {}, sum); return 0; }\",\n",

      "  \"name\": \"The name is derived from Kotlin Island, a Russian island in the Gulf of Finland, near Saint Petersburg. Andrey Breslav, Kotlin's former lead designer, mentioned that the team decided to name it after an island, in imitation of the Java programming language which shares a name with the Indonesian island of Java.\",\n",
      "  \"development\": \"The first commit to the Kotlin Git repository was on November 8, 2010. In July 2011, JetBrains unveiled Project Kotlin, a new language for the JVM, which had been under development for a year. JetBrains lead Dmitry Jemerov said that most languages did not have the features they were looking for, with the exception of Scala. However, he cited the slow compilation time of Scala as a deficiency. One of the stated goals of Kotlin is to compile as quickly as Java. In February 2012, JetBrains open sourced the project under the Apache 2 license. JetBrains expected Kotlin to drive IntelliJ IDEA sales. Kotlin 1.0 was released on February 15, 2016. This is considered to be the first officially stable release and JetBrains has committed to long-term backwards compatibility starting with this version. At Google I/O 2017, Google announced first-class support for Kotlin on Android. Kotlin 1.1 was released on March 1, 2017. Kotlin 1.2 was released on November 28, 2017. Sharing code between JVM and JavaScript platforms feature was newly added to this release (multiplatform programming is by now a beta feature upgraded from experimental). A full-stack demo has been made with the new Kotlin/JS Gradle Plugin. Kotlin 1.3 was released on 29 October 2018, adding support for coroutines for use with asynchronous programming. On 7 May 2019, Google announced that the Kotlin programming language is now its preferred language for Android app developers. Kotlin 1.4 was released in August 2020, with e.g. some slight changes to the support for Apple's platforms, i.e. to the Objective-C/Swift interop. Kotlin 1.5 was released in May 2021. Kotlin 1.6 was released in November 2021. Kotlin 1.7 was released in June 2022, including the alpha version of the new Kotlin K2 compiler. Kotlin 1.8 was released in December 2022, 1.8.0 was released on January 11, 2023. Kotlin 1.9 was released in July 2023, 1.9.0 was released on July 6, 2023. Kotlin 2.0 was released in May 2024, 2.0.0 was released on May 21, 2024. Kotlin 2.1 was released in November 2024, 2.1.0 was released on November 27, 2024.\",\n",
      "  \"design\": \"Development lead Andrey Breslav has said that Kotlin is designed to be an industrial-strength object-oriented language, and a better language than Java, but still be fully interoperable with Java code, allowing companies to make a gradual migration from Java to Kotlin. Semicolons are optional as a statement terminator; in most cases a newline is sufficient for the compiler to deduce that the statement has ended. Kotlin variable declarations and parameter lists have the data type come after the variable name (and with a colon separator), similar to Ada, BASIC, Pascal, TypeScript and Rust. This, according to an article from Roman Elizarov, current project lead, results in alignment of variable names and is more pleasing to eyes, especially when there are a few variable declarations in succession, and one or more of the types is too complex for type inference, or needs to be declared explicitly for human readers to understand. The influence of Scala in Kotlin can be seen in the extensive support for both object-oriented and functional programming and in a number of specific features: there is a distinction between mutable and immutable variables (var vs val keyword) all classes are public and final (non-inheritable) by default functions and methods support default arguments, variable-length argument lists and named arguments Kotlin 1.3 added support for contracts, which are stable for the standard library declarations, but still experimental for user-defined declarations. Contracts are inspired by Eiffel's design by contract programming paradigm. Following ScalaJS, Kotlin code may be transpiled to JavaScript, allowing for interoperability between code written in the two languages. This can be used either to write full web applications in Kotlin, or to share code between a Kotlin backend and a JavaScript frontend.\",\n",
      "  \"procedural_programming_style\": \"Kotlin relaxes Java's restriction of allowing static methods and variables to exist only within a class body. Static objects and functions can be defined at the top level of the package without needing a redundant class level. For compatibility with Java, Kotlin provides a JvmName annotation which specifies a class name used when the package is viewed from a Java project. For example, @file:JvmName(JavaClassName).\",\n",
      "  \"main_entry_point\": \"Main article: Entry point As in C, C++, C#, Java, and Go, the entry point to a Kotlin program is a function named main, which may be passed an array containing any command-line arguments. This is optional since Kotlin 1.3. Perl, PHP, and Unix shell–style string interpolation is supported. Type inference is also supported. // Hello, World! example fun main() { val scope = World println(Hello, $scope!) } fun main(args: Array<String>) { for (arg in args) println(arg) }\",\n",
      "  \"extension_functions\": \"Similar to C#, Kotlin allows adding an extension function to any class without the formalities of creating a derived class with new functions. An extension function has access to all the public interface of a class, which it can use to create a new function interface to a target class. An extension function will appear exactly like a function of the class and will be shown in code completion inspection of class functions. For example: package com.example.myStringExtensions fun String.lastChar(): Char = get(length - 1) >>> println(Kotlin.lastChar()) By placing the preceding code in the top-level of a package, the String class is extended to include a lastChar function that was not included in the original definition of the String class. // Overloading '+' operator using an extension function operator fun Point.plus(other: Point): Point { return Point(x + other.x, y + other.y) } >>> val p1 = Point(10, 20) >>> val p2 = Point(30, 40) >>> println(p1 + p2) Point(x=40, y=60)\",\n",
      "  \"scope_functions\": \"Kotlin has five scope functions, which allow the changing of scope within the context of an object. The scope functions are let, run, with, apply, and also.\",\n",
      "  \"unpack_arguments_with_spread_operator\": \"Similar to Python, the spread operator asterisk (*) unpacks an array's contents as individual arguments to a function, e.g.: fun main(args: Array<String>) { val list = listOf(args: , *args) println(list) }\",\n",
      "  \"destructuring_declarations\": \"Not to be confused with the destructor method common in object-oriented languages. Destructuring declarations decompose an object into multiple variables at once, e.g. a 2D coordinate object might be destructured into two integers, x and y. For example, the Map.Entry object supports destructuring to simplify access to its key and value fields: for ((key, value) in map) println($key: $value)\",\n",
      "  \"nested_functions\": \"Kotlin allows local functions to be declared inside of other functions or methods. class User(val id: Int, val name: String, val address: String) fun saveUserToDb(user: User) { fun validate(user: User, value: String, fieldName: String) { require(value.isNotEmpty()) { Can't save user ${user.id}: empty $fieldName } } validate(user, user.name, Name) validate(user, user.address, Address) // Save user to the database ... }\",\n",
      "  \"classes_are_final_by_default\": \"In Kotlin, to derive a new class from a base class type, the base class needs to be explicitly marked as open. This is in contrast to most object-oriented languages such as Java where classes are open by default. Example of a base class that is open to deriving a new subclass from it: // open on the class means this class will allow derived classes open class MegaButton { // no-open on a function means that // polymorphic behavior disabled if function overridden in derived class fun disable() { ... } // open on a function means that // polymorphic behavior allowed if function is overridden in derived class open fun animate() { ... } } class GigaButton: MegaButton() { // Explicit use of override keyword required to override a function in derived class override fun animate() { println(Giga Click!) } }\",\n",
      "  \"abstract_classes_are_open_by_default\": \"Main article: Abstract class Abstract classes define abstract or pure virtual placeholder functions that will be defined in a derived class. Abstract classes are open by default. // No need for the open keyword here, it’s already open by default abstract class Animated { // This virtual function is already open by default as well abstract fun animate() open fun stopAnimating() { } fun animateTwice() { } }\",\n",
      "  \"classes_are_public_by_default\": \"Kotlin provides the following keywords to restrict visibility for top-level declaration, such as classes, and for class members: public, internal, protected, and private. When applied to a class member: Keyword Visibility public (default) Everywhere internal Within a module protected Within subclasses private Within a class When applied to a top-level declaration: Keyword Visibility public (default) Everywhere internal Within a module private Within a file Example: // Class is visible only to current module internal open class TalkativeButton { // method is only visible to current class private fun yell() = println(Hey!) // method is visible to current class and derived classes protected fun whisper() = println(Let's talk!) } internal class MyTalkativeButton: TalkativeButton() { fun utter() = super.whisper() } MyTalkativeButton().utter()\",\n",
      "  \"primary_constructor_vs_secondary_constructors\": \"Kotlin supports the specification of a primary constructor as part of the class definition itself, consisting of an argument list following the class name. This argument list supports an expanded syntax on Kotlin's standard function argument lists that enables declaration of class properties in the primary constructor, including visibility, extensibility, and mutability attributes. Additionally, when defining a subclass, properties in super-interfaces and super-classes can be overridden in the primary constructor. // Example of class using primary constructor syntax // (Only one constructor required for this class) open class BaseUser(open var isSubscribed: Boolean) open class PowerUser(protected val nickname: String, final override var isSubscribed: Boolean = true):BaseUser(isSubscribed) { } However, in cases where more than one constructor is needed for a class, a more general constructor can be defined using secondary constructor syntax, which closely resembles the constructor syntax used in most object-oriented languages like C++, C#, and Java. // Example of class using secondary constructor syntax // (more than one constructor required for this class) class Context class AttributeSet open class View(ctx:Context) { constructor(ctx: Context, attr: AttributeSet): this(ctx) } class MyButton : View { // Constructor #1 constructor(ctx: Context) : super(ctx) { } // Constructor #2 constructor(ctx: Context, attr: AttributeSet) : super(ctx, attr) { // ... } }\",\n",
      "  \"sealed_classes\": \"Sealed classes and interfaces restrict subclass hierarchies, meaning more control over the inheritance hierarchy. Declaration of sealed interface and class: sealed interface Expr sealed class Job All the subclasses of the sealed class are defined at compile time. No new subclasses can be added to it after the compilation of the module having the sealed class. For example, a sealed class in a compiled jar file cannot be subclassed. sealed class Vehicle data class Car(val brandName: String, val owner: String, val color: String): Vehicle() class Bike(val brandName: String, val owner: String, val color: String): Vehicle() class Tractor(val brandName: String, val owner: String, val color: String): Vehicle() val kiaCar = Car(KIA, John, Blue) val hyundaiCar = Car(Hyundai, Britto, Green)\",\n",
      "  \"data_classes\": \"Kotlin's data class construct defines classes whose primary purpose is storing data, similar to Java's record types. Like Java's record types, the construct is similar to normal classes except that the key methods equals, hashCode and toString are automatically generated from the class properties. Unlike Java's records, data classes are open for inheritance.\",\n",
      "  \"kotlin_interactive_shell\": \"$ kotlinc-jvm type :help for help; :quit for quit >>> 2 + 2 4 >>> println(Hello, World!) Hello, World!\",\n",
      "  \"kotlin_as_a_scripting_language\": \"Kotlin can also be used as a scripting language. A script is a Kotlin source file using the .kts filename extension, with executable source code at the top-level scope: // list_folders.kts import java.io.File val folders = File(args).listFiles { file -> file.isDirectory() } folders?.forEach(::println) Scripts can be run by passing the -script option and the corresponding script file to the compiler. $ kotlinc -script list_folders.kts path_to_folder_to_inspect\",\n",
      "  \"null_safety\": \"Kotlin makes a distinction between nullable and non-nullable data types. All nullable objects must be declared with a ? postfix after the type name. Operations on nullable objects need special care from developers: a null-check must be performed before using the value, either explicitly, or with the aid of Kotlin's null-safe operators: ?. (the safe navigation operator) can be used to safely access a method or property of a possibly null object. If the object is null, the method will not be called and the expression evaluates to null. Example: // returns null if... // - foo() returns null, // - or if foo() is non-null, but bar() returns null, // - or if foo() and bar() are non-null, but baz() returns null. // vice versa, return value is non-null if and only if foo(), bar() and baz() are non-null foo()?.bar()?.baz() ?: (the null coalescing operator) is a binary operator that returns the first operand, if non-null, else the second operand. It is often referred to as the Elvis operator, due to its resemblance to an emoticon representation of Elvis Presley. fun sayHello(maybe: String?, neverNull: Int) { // use of Elvis operator val name: String = maybe ?: stranger println(Hello $name) }\",\n",
      "  \"lambdas\": \"Kotlin provides support for higher-order functions and anonymous functions, or lambdas. // the following function takes a lambda, f, and executes f passing it the string lambda // note that (String) -> Unit indicates a lambda with a String parameter and Unit return type fun executeLambda(f: (String) -> Unit) { f(lambda) } Lambdas are declared using braces, { }. If a lambda takes parameters, they are declared within the braces and followed by the -> operator. // the following statement defines a lambda that takes a single parameter and passes it to the println function val l = { c : Any? -> println(c) } // lambdas with no parameters may simply be defined using { } val l2 = { print(no parameters) }\",\n",
      "  \"tools\": \"Android Studio (based on IntelliJ IDEA) has official support for Kotlin, starting from Android Studio 3. Integration with common Java build tools is supported, including Apache Maven, Apache Ant, and Gradle. Emacs has a Kotlin Mode in its MELPA package repository. JetBrains also provides a plugin for Eclipse. IntelliJ IDEA has plug-in support for Kotlin. IntelliJ IDEA 15 was the first version to bundle the Kotlin plugin in the IntelliJ Installer, and to provide Kotlin support out of the box. Gradle: Kotlin has seamless integration with Gradle, which is a popular build automation tool. Gradle allows you to build, automate, and manage the lifecycle of your Kotlin projects efficiently\",\n",
      "  \"applications\": \"When Kotlin was announced as an official Android development language at Google I/O in May 2017, it became the third language fully supported for Android, after Java and C++. As of 2020[update], Kotlin was the most widely used language on Android, with Google estimating that 70% of the top 1,000 apps on the Play Store were written in Kotlin. Google itself had 60 apps written in Kotlin, including Maps and Drive. Many Android apps, such as Google Home, were in the process of being migrated to Kotlin, and therefore use both Kotlin and Java. Kotlin on Android is seen as beneficial for its null-pointer safety, as well as for its features that make for shorter, more readable code. In addition to its prominent use on Android, Kotlin was gaining traction in server-side development. The Spring Framework officially added Kotlin support with version 5, on 4 January 2017. To further support Kotlin, Spring has translated all its documentation to Kotlin, and added built-in support for many Kotlin-specific features such as coroutines. In addition to Spring, JetBrains has produced a Kotlin-first framework called Ktor for building web applications. In 2020, JetBrains found in a survey of developers who use Kotlin that 56% were using Kotlin for mobile apps, while 47% were using it for a web back-end. Just over a third of all Kotlin developers said that they were migrating to Kotlin from another language. Most Kotlin users were targeting Android (or otherwise on the JVM), with only 6% using Kotlin Native.\",\n",

      "  \"history\": \"The design of Scala started in 2001 at the École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL) (in Lausanne, Switzerland) by Martin Odersky. It followed on from work on Funnel, a programming language combining ideas from functional programming and Petri nets. Odersky formerly worked on Generic Java, and javac, Sun's Java compiler. After an internal release in late 2003, Scala was released publicly in early 2004 on the Java platform, A second version (v2.0) followed in March 2006. On 17 January 2011, the Scala team won a five-year research grant of over €2.3 million from the European Research Council. On 12 May 2011, Odersky and collaborators launched Typesafe Inc. (later renamed Lightbend Inc.), a company to provide commercial support, training, and services for Scala. Typesafe received a $3 million investment in 2011 from Greylock Partners.\",\n",
      "  \"platforms_and_license\": \"Scala runs on the Java platform (Java virtual machine) and is compatible with existing Java programs. As Android applications are typically written in Java and translated from Java bytecode into Dalvik bytecode (which may be further translated to native machine code during installation) when packaged, Scala's Java compatibility makes it well-suited to Android development, the more so when a functional approach is preferred. The reference Scala software distribution, including compiler and libraries, is released under the Apache license.\",\n",
      "  \"other_compilers_and_targets\": \"Scala.js is a Scala compiler that compiles to JavaScript, making it possible to write Scala programs that can run in web browsers or Node.js. The compiler, in development since 2013, was announced as no longer experimental in 2015 (v0.6). Version v1.0.0-M1 was released in June 2018 and version 1.1.1 in September 2020. Scala Native is a Scala compiler that targets the LLVM compiler infrastructure to create executable code that uses a lightweight managed runtime, which uses the Boehm garbage collector. The project is led by Denys Shabalin and had its first release, 0.1, on 14 March 2017. Development of Scala Native began in 2015 with a goal of being faster than just-in-time compilation for the JVM by eliminating the initial runtime compilation of code and also providing the ability to call native routines directly. A reference Scala compiler targeting the .NET Framework and its Common Language Runtime was released in June 2004, but was officially dropped in 2012.\",\n",
      "  \"basic_example\": \"The following example shows the differences between Java and Scala syntax. The function mathFunction takes an integer, squares it, and then adds the cube root of that number to the natural log of that number, returning the result (i.e., n 2 / 3 + ln ⁡ ( n 2 ) {\\\\displaystyle n^{2/3}+\\\\ln(n^{2})} ): // Java: int mathFunction(int num) { int numSquare = num*num; return (int) (Math.cbrt(numSquare) + Math.log(numSquare)); } // Scala: Direct conversion from Java // no import needed; scala.math // already imported as `math` def mathFunction(num: Int): Int = var numSquare: Int = num*num return (math.cbrt(numSquare) + math.log(numSquare)). asInstanceOf[Int] // Scala: More idiomatic // Uses type inference, omits `return` statement, // uses `toInt` method, declares numSquare immutable import math.* def mathFunction(num: Int) = val numSquare = num*num (cbrt(numSquare) + log(numSquare)).toInt Some syntactic differences in this code are: Scala does not require semicolons (;) to end statements. Value types are capitalized (sentence case): Int, Double, Boolean instead of int, double, boolean. Parameter and return types follow, as in Pascal, rather than precede as in C. Methods must be preceded by def. Local or class variables must be preceded by val (indicates an immutable variable) or var (indicates a mutable variable). The return operator is unnecessary in a function (although allowed); the value of the last executed statement or expression is normally the function's value. Instead of the Java cast operator (Type) foo, Scala uses foo.asInstanceOf[Type], or a specialized function such as toDouble or toInt. Function or method foo() can also be called as just foo; method thread.send(signo) can also be called as just thread send signo; and method foo.toString() can also be called as just foo toString. These syntactic relaxations are designed to allow support for domain-specific languages. Some other basic syntactic differences: Array references are written like function calls, e.g. array(i) rather than array[i]. (Internally in Scala, the former expands into array.apply(i) which returns the reference) Generic types are written as e.g. List[String] rather than Java's List<String>. Instead of the pseudo-type void, Scala has the actual singleton class Unit (see below).\",\n",
      "  \"example_with_classes\": \"The following example contrasts the definition of classes in Java and Scala. // Java: public class Point { private double x, y; public Point(double x, double y) { this.x = x; this.y = y; } public Point(double x, double y, boolean addToGrid) { this(x, y); if (addToGrid) grid.addPoint(this); } public Point() { this(0.0, 0.0); } private void addPoint(Point p) { x += p.x; y += p.y; } public double getX() { return x; } public double getY() { return y; } double distanceToPoint(Point other) { return distanceBetweenPoints(x, y, other.x, other.y); } private static Point grid = new Point(); static double distanceBetweenPoints( double x1, double y1, double x2, double y2) { return Math.hypot(x1 - x2, y1 - y2); } } // Scala class Point( var x: Double, var y: Double, addToGrid: Boolean = false ): import Point.* def += (p: Point) = x += p.x y += p.y if (addToGrid) grid += this def this() = this(0.0, 0.0) def distanceToPoint(other: Point) = distanceBetweenPoints(x, y, other.x, other.y) end Point object Point: private val grid = new Point() def distanceBetweenPoints(x1: Double, y1: Double, x2: Double, y2: Double) = math.hypot(x1 - x2, y1 - y2) The code above shows some of the conceptual differences between Java and Scala's handling of classes: Scala has no static variables or methods. Instead, it has singleton objects, which are essentially classes with only one instance. Singleton objects are declared using object instead of class. It is common to place static variables and methods in a singleton object with the same name as the class name, which is then known as a companion object. (The underlying class for the singleton object has a $ appended. Hence, for class Foo with companion object object Foo, under the hood there's a class Foo$ containing the companion object's code, and one object of this class is created, using the singleton pattern.) In place of constructor parameters, Scala has class parameters, which are placed on the class, similar to parameters to a function. When declared with a val or var modifier, fields are also defined with the same name, and automatically initialized from the class parameters. (Under the hood, external access to public fields always goes through accessor (getter) and mutator (setter) methods, which are automatically created. The accessor function has the same name as the field, which is why it's unnecessary in the above example to explicitly declare accessor methods.) Note that alternative constructors can also be declared, as in Java. Code that would go into the default constructor (other than initializing the member variables) goes directly at class level. In Scala it is possible to define operators by using symbols as method names. In place of addPoint, the Scala example defines +=, which is then invoked with infix notation as grid += this. Default visibility in Scala is public.\",\n",
      "  \"features_with_reference_to_java\": \"Scala has the same compiling model as Java and C#, namely separate compiling and dynamic class loading, so that Scala code can call Java libraries. Scala's operational characteristics are the same as Java's. The Scala compiler generates byte code that is nearly identical to that generated by the Java compiler. In fact, Scala code can be decompiled to readable Java code, with the exception of certain constructor operations. To the Java virtual machine (JVM), Scala code and Java code are indistinguishable. The only difference is one extra runtime library, scala-library.jar. Scala adds a large number of features compared with Java, and has some fundamental differences in its underlying model of expressions and types, which make the language theoretically cleaner and eliminate several corner cases in Java. From the Scala perspective, this is practically important because several added features in Scala are also available in C#.\",\n",
      "  \"syntactic_flexibility\": \"As mentioned above, Scala has a good deal of syntactic flexibility, compared with Java. The following are some examples: Semicolons are unnecessary; lines are automatically joined if they begin or end with a token that cannot normally come in this position, or if there are unclosed parentheses or brackets. Any method can be used as an infix operator, e.g. %d apples.format(num) and %d apples format num are equivalent. In fact, arithmetic operators like + and << are treated just like any other methods, since function names are allowed to consist of sequences of arbitrary symbols (with a few exceptions made for things like parens, brackets and braces that must be handled specially); the only special treatment that such symbol-named methods undergo concerns the handling of precedence. Methods apply and update have syntactic short forms. foo()—where foo is a value (singleton object or class instance)—is short for foo.apply(), and foo() = 42 is short for foo.update(42). Similarly, foo(42) is short for foo.apply(42), and foo(4) = 2 is short for foo.update(4, 2). This is used for collection classes and extends to many other cases, such as STM cells. Scala distinguishes between no-parens (def foo = 42) and empty-parens (def foo() = 42) methods. When calling an empty-parens method, the parentheses may be omitted, which is useful when calling into Java libraries that do not know this distinction, e.g., using foo.toString instead of foo.toString(). By convention, a method should be defined with empty-parens when it performs side effects. Method names ending in colon (:) expect the argument on the left-hand-side and the receiver on the right-hand-side. For example, the 4 :: 2 :: Nil is the same as Nil.::(2).::(4), the first form corresponding visually to the result (a list with first element 4 and second element 2). Class body variables can be transparently implemented as separate getter and setter methods. For trait FooLike { var bar: Int }, an implementation may be object Foo extends FooLike { private var x = 0; def bar = x; def bar_=(value: Int) { x = value }} } }. The call site will still be able to use a concise foo.bar = 42. The use of curly braces instead of parentheses is allowed in method calls. This allows pure library implementations of new control structures. For example, breakable { ... if (...) break() ... } looks as if breakable was a language defined keyword, but really is just a method taking a thunk argument. Methods that take thunks or functions often place these in a second parameter list, allowing to mix parentheses and curly braces syntax: Vector.fill(4) { math.random } is the same as Vector.fill(4)(math.random). The curly braces variant allows the expression to span multiple lines. For-expressions (explained further down) can accommodate any type that defines monadic methods such as map, flatMap and filter. By themselves, these may seem like questionable choices, but collectively they serve the purpose of allowing domain-specific languages to be defined in Scala without needing to extend the compiler. For example, Erlang's special syntax for sending a message to an actor, i.e. actor ! message can be (and is) implemented in a Scala library without needing language extensions.\",\n",
      "  \"unified_type_system\": \"Java makes a sharp distinction between primitive types (e.g. int and boolean) and reference types (any class). Only reference types are part of the inheritance scheme, deriving from java.lang.Object. In Scala, all types inherit from a top-level class Any, whose immediate children are AnyVal (value types, such as Int and Boolean) and AnyRef (reference types, as in Java). This means that the Java distinction between primitive types and boxed types (e.g. int vs. Integer) is not present in Scala; boxing and unboxing is completely transparent to the user. Scala 2.10 allows for new value types to be defined by the user.\",\n",
      "  \"for_expressions\": \"Instead of the Java foreach loops for looping through an iterator, Scala has for-expressions, which are similar to list comprehensions in languages such as Haskell, or a combination of list comprehensions and generator expressions in Python. For-expressions using the yield keyword allow a new collection to be generated by iterating over an existing one, returning a new collection of the same type. They are translated by the compiler into a series of map, flatMap and filter calls. Where yield is not used, the code approximates to an imperative-style loop, by translating to foreach. A simple example is: val s = for (x <- 1 to 25 if x*x > 50) yield 2*x The result of running it is the following vector: Vector(16, 18, 20, 22, 24, 26, 28, 30, 32, 34, 36, 38, 40, 42, 44, 46, 48, 50) (Note that the expression 1 to 25 is not special syntax. The method to is rather defined in the standard Scala library as an extension method on integers, using a technique known as implicit conversions that allows new methods to be added to existing types.) A more complex example of iterating over a map is: // Given a map specifying Twitter users mentioned in a set of tweets, // and number of times each user was mentioned, look up the users // in a map of known politicians, and return a new map giving only the // Democratic politicians (as objects, rather than strings). val dem_mentions = for (mention, times) <- mentions account <- accounts.get(mention) if account.party == Democratic yield (account, times) Expression (mention, times) <- mentions is an example of pattern matching (see below). Iterating over a map returns a set of key-value tuples, and pattern-matching allows the tuples to easily be destructured into separate variables for the key and value. Similarly, the result of the comprehension also returns key-value tuples, which are automatically built back up into a map because the source object (from the variable mentions) is a map. Note that if mentions instead held a list, set, array or other collection of tuples, exactly the same code above would yield a new collection of the same type.\",\n",
      "  \"functional_tendencies\": \"While supporting all of the object-oriented features available in Java (and in fact, augmenting them in various ways), Scala also provides a large number of capabilities that are normally found only in functional programming languages. Together, these features allow Scala programs to be written in an almost completely functional style and also allow functional and object-oriented styles to be mixed. Examples are: No distinction between statements and expressions Type inference Anonymous functions with capturing semantics (i.e., closures) Immutable variables and objects Lazy evaluation Delimited continuations (since 2.8) Higher-order functions Nested functions Currying Pattern matching Algebraic data types (through case classes) Tuples\",\n",
      "  \"everything_is_an_expression\": \"Unlike C or Java, but similar to languages such as Lisp, Scala makes no distinction between statements and expressions. All statements are in fact expressions that evaluate to some value. Functions that would be declared as returning void in C or Java, and statements like while that logically do not return a value, are in Scala considered to return the type Unit, which is a singleton type, with only one object of that type. Functions and operators that never return at all (e.g. the throw operator or a function that always exits non-locally using an exception) logically have return type Nothing, a special type containing no objects; that is, a bottom type, i.e. a subclass of every possible type. (This in turn makes type Nothing compatible with every type, allowing type inference to function correctly.) Similarly, an if-then-else statement is actually an expression, which produces a value, i.e. the result of evaluating one of the two branches. This means that such a block of code can be inserted wherever an expression is desired, obviating the need for a ternary operator in Scala: // Java: char hexDigit = (char)(x >= 10 ? x + 'A' - 10 : x + '0'); // Scala: val hexDigit = (if x >= 10 then x + 'A' - 10 else x + '0').toChar For similar reasons, return statements are unnecessary in Scala, and in fact are discouraged. As in Lisp, the last expression in a block of code is the value of that block of code, and if the block of code is the body of a function, it will be returned by the function. To make it clear that all functions are expressions, even methods that return Unit are written with an equals sign def printValue(x: String): Unit = println(I ate a %s.format(x)) or equivalently (with type inference, and omitting the unnecessary newline): def printValue(x: String) = println(I ate a %s format x)\",\n",
      "  \"type_inference\": \"Due to type inference, the type of variables, function return values, and many other expressions can typically be omitted, as the compiler can deduce it. Examples are val x = foo (for an immutable constant or immutable object) or var x = 1.5 (for a variable whose value can later be changed). Type inference in Scala is essentially local, in contrast to the more global Hindley-Milner algorithm used in Haskell, ML and other more purely functional languages. This is done to facilitate object-oriented programming. The result is that certain types still need to be declared (most notably, function parameters, and the return types of recursive functions), e.g. def formatApples(x: Int) = I ate %d apples.format(x) or (with a return type declared for a recursive function) def factorial(x: Int): Int = if x == 0 then 1 else x * factorial(x - 1)\",\n",
      "  \"anonymous_functions\": \"In Scala, functions are objects, and a convenient syntax exists for specifying anonymous functions. An example is the expression x => x < 2, which specifies a function with one parameter, that compares its argument to see if it is less than 2. It is equivalent to the Lisp form (lambda (x) (< x 2)). Note that neither the type of x nor the return type need be explicitly specified, and can generally be inferred by type inference; but they can be explicitly specified, e.g. as (x: Int) => x < 2 or even (x: Int) => (x < 2): Boolean. Anonymous functions behave as true closures in that they automatically capture any variables that are lexically available in the environment of the enclosing function. Those variables will be available even after the enclosing function returns, and unlike in the case of Java's anonymous inner classes do not need to be declared as final. (It is even possible to modify such variables if they are mutable, and the modified value will be available the next time the anonymous function is called.) An even shorter form of anonymous function uses placeholder variables: For example, the following: list map { x => sqrt(x) } can be written more concisely as list map { sqrt(_) } or even list map sqrt\",\n",
      "  \"immutability\": \"Scala enforces a distinction between immutable and mutable variables. Mutable variables are declared using the var keyword and immutable values are declared using the val keyword. A variable declared using the val keyword cannot be reassigned in the same way that a variable declared using the final keyword can't be reassigned in Java. vals are only shallowly immutable, that is, an object referenced by a val is not guaranteed to itself be immutable. Immutable classes are encouraged by convention however, and the Scala standard library provides a rich set of immutable collection classes. Scala provides mutable and immutable variants of most collection classes, and the immutable version is always used unless the mutable version is explicitly imported. The immutable variants are persistent data structures that always return an updated copy of an old object instead of updating the old object destructively in place. An example of this is immutable linked lists where prepending an element to a list is done by returning a new list node consisting of the element and a reference to the list tail. Appending an element to a list can only be done by prepending all elements in the old list to a new list with only the new element. In the same way, inserting an element in the middle of a list will copy the first half of the list, but keep a reference to the second half of the list. This is called structural sharing. This allows for very easy concurrency — no locks are needed as no shared objects are ever modified.\",\n",
      "  \"lazy_non_strict_evaluation\": \"Evaluation is strict (eager) by default. In other words, Scala evaluates expressions as soon as they are available, rather than as needed. However, it is possible to declare a variable non-strict (lazy) with the lazy keyword, meaning that the code to produce the variable's value will not be evaluated until the first time the variable is referenced. Non-strict collections of various types also exist (such as the type Stream, a non-strict linked list), and any collection can be made non-strict with the view method. Non-strict collections provide a good semantic fit to things like server-produced data, where the evaluation of the code to generate later elements of a list (that in turn triggers a request to a server, possibly located somewhere else on the web) only happens when the elements are actually needed.\",\n",
      "  \"tail_recursion\": \"Functional programming languages commonly provide tail call optimization to allow for extensive use of recursion without stack overflow problems. Limitations in Java bytecode complicate tail call optimization on the JVM. In general, a function that calls itself with a tail call can be optimized, but mutually recursive functions cannot. Trampolines have been suggested as a workaround. Trampoline support has been provided by the Scala library with the object scala.util.control.TailCalls since Scala 2.8.0 (released 14 July 2010). A function may optionally be annotated with @tailrec, in which case it will not compile unless it is tail recursive. An example of this optimization could be implemented using the factorial definition. For instance, the recursive version of the factorial: def factorial(n: Int): Int = if n == 0 then 1 else n * factorial(n - 1) Could be optimized to the tail recursive version like this: @tailrec def factorial(n: Int, accum: Int): Int = if n == 0 then accum else factorial(n - 1, n * accum) However, this could compromise composability with other functions because of the new argument on its definition, so it is common to use closures to preserve its original signature: def factorial(n: Int): Int = @tailrec def loop(current: Int, accum: Int): Int = if n == 0 then accum else loop(current - 1, n * accum) loop(n, 1) // Call to the closure using the base case end factorial This ensures tail call optimization and thus prevents a stack overflow error.\",\n",
      "  \"case_classes_and_pattern_matching\": \"Scala has built-in support for pattern matching, which can be thought of as a more sophisticated, extensible version of a switch statement, where arbitrary data types can be matched (rather than just simple types like integers, Booleans and strings), including arbitrary nesting. A special type of class known as a case class is provided, which includes automatic support for pattern matching and can be used to model the algebraic data types used in many functional programming languages. (From the perspective of Scala, a case class is simply a normal class for which the compiler automatically adds certain behaviors that could also be provided manually, e.g., definitions of methods providing for deep comparisons and hashing, and destructuring a case class on its constructor parameters during pattern matching.) An example of a definition of the quicksort algorithm using pattern matching is this: def qsort(list: List[Int]): List[Int] = list match case Nil => Nil case pivot :: tail => val (smaller, rest) = tail.partition(_ < pivot) qsort(smaller) ::: pivot :: qsort(rest) The idea here is that we partition a list into the elements less than a pivot and the elements not less, recursively sort each part, and paste the results together with the pivot in between. This uses the same divide-and-conquer strategy of mergesort and other fast sorting algorithms. The match operator is used to do pattern matching on the object stored in list. Each case expression is tried in turn to see if it will match, and the first match determines the result. In this case, Nil only matches the literal object Nil, but pivot :: tail matches a non-empty list, and simultaneously destructures the list according to the pattern given. In this case, the associated code will have access to a local variable named pivot holding the head of the list, and another variable tail holding the tail of the list. Note that these variables are read-only, and are semantically very similar to variable bindings established using the let operator in Lisp and Scheme. Pattern matching also happens in local variable declarations. In this case, the return value of the call to tail.partition is a tuple — in this case, two lists. (Tuples differ from other types of containers, e.g. lists, in that they are always of fixed size and the elements can be of differing types — although here they are both the same.) Pattern matching is the easiest way of fetching the two parts of the tuple. The form _ < pivot is a declaration of an anonymous function with a placeholder variable; see the section above on anonymous functions. The list operators :: (which adds an element onto the beginning of a list, similar to cons in Lisp and Scheme) and ::: (which appends two lists together, similar to append in Lisp and Scheme) both appear. Despite appearances, there is nothing built-in about either of these operators. As specified above, any string of symbols can serve as function name, and a method applied to an object can be written infix-style without the period or parentheses. The line above as written: qsort(smaller) ::: pivot :: qsort(rest) could also be written thus: qsort(rest).::(pivot).:::(qsort(smaller)) in more standard method-call notation.

      "  \"partial_functions\": \"In the pattern-matching example above, the body of the match operator is a partial function, which consists of a series of case expressions, with the first matching expression prevailing, similar to the body of a switch statement. Partial functions are also used in the exception-handling portion of a try statement: try ... catch case nfe: NumberFormatException => { println(nfe); List(0) } case _ => Nil Finally, a partial function can be used alone, and the result of calling it is equivalent to doing a match over it. For example, the prior code for quicksort can be written thus: val qsort: List[Int] => List[Int] = case Nil => Nil case pivot :: tail => val (smaller, rest) = tail.partition(_ < pivot) qsort(smaller) ::: pivot :: qsort(rest) Here a read-only variable is declared whose type is a function from lists of integers to lists of integers, and bind it to a partial function. (Note that the single parameter of the partial function is never explicitly declared or named.) However, we can still call this variable exactly as if it were a normal function: scala> qsort(List(6,2,5,9)) res32: List[Int] = List(2, 5, 6, 9)\",\n",
      "  \"object_oriented_extensions\": \"Scala is a pure object-oriented language in the sense that every value is an object. Data types and behaviors of objects are described by classes and traits. Class abstractions are extended by subclassing and by a flexible mixin-based composition mechanism to avoid the problems of multiple inheritance. Traits are Scala's replacement for Java's interfaces. Interfaces in Java versions under 8 are highly restricted, able only to contain abstract function declarations. This has led to criticism that providing convenience methods in interfaces is awkward (the same methods must be reimplemented in every implementation), and extending a published interface in a backwards-compatible way is impossible. Traits are similar to mixin classes in that they have nearly all the power of a regular abstract class, lacking only class parameters (Scala's equivalent to Java's constructor parameters), since traits are always mixed in with a class. The super operator behaves specially in traits, allowing traits to be chained using composition in addition to inheritance. The following example is a simple window system: abstract class Window: // abstract def draw() class SimpleWindow extends Window: def draw() println(in SimpleWindow) // draw a basic window trait WindowDecoration extends Window trait HorizontalScrollbarDecoration extends WindowDecoration: // abstract override is needed here for super() to work because the parent // function is abstract. If it were concrete, regular override would be enough. abstract override def draw() println(in HorizontalScrollbarDecoration) super.draw() // now draw a horizontal scrollbar trait VerticalScrollbarDecoration extends WindowDecoration: abstract override def draw() println(in VerticalScrollbarDecoration) super.draw() // now draw a vertical scrollbar trait TitleDecoration extends WindowDecoration: abstract override def draw() println(in TitleDecoration) super.draw() // now draw the title bar A variable may be declared thus: val mywin = new SimpleWindow with VerticalScrollbarDecoration with HorizontalScrollbarDecoration with TitleDecoration The result of calling mywin.draw() is: in TitleDecoration in HorizontalScrollbarDecoration in VerticalScrollbarDecoration in SimpleWindow In other words, the call to draw first executed the code in TitleDecoration (the last trait mixed in), then (through the super() calls) threaded back through the other mixed-in traits and eventually to the code in Window, even though none of the traits inherited from one another. This is similar to the decorator pattern, but is more concise and less error-prone, as it doesn't require explicitly encapsulating the parent window, explicitly forwarding functions whose implementation isn't changed, or relying on run-time initialization of entity relationships. In other languages, a similar effect could be achieved at compile-time with a long linear chain of implementation inheritance, but with the disadvantage compared to Scala that one linear inheritance chain would have to be declared for each possible combination of the mix-ins.\",\n",
      "  \"expressive_type_system\": \"Scala is equipped with an expressive static type system that mostly enforces the safe and coherent use of abstractions. The type system is, however, not sound. In particular, the type system supports: Classes and abstract types as object members Structural types Path-dependent types Compound types Explicitly typed self references Generic classes Polymorphic methods Upper and lower type bounds Variance Annotation Views Scala is able to infer types by use. This makes most static type declarations optional. Static types need not be explicitly declared unless a compiler error indicates the need. In practice, some static type declarations are included for the sake of code clarity.\",\n",
      "  \"type_enrichment\": \"A common technique in Scala, known as enrich my library (originally termed pimp my library by Martin Odersky in 2006; concerns were raised about this phrasing due to its negative connotations and immaturity), allows new methods to be used as if they were added to existing types. This is similar to the C# concept of extension methods but more powerful, because the technique is not limited to adding methods and can, for instance, be used to implement new interfaces. In Scala, this technique involves declaring an implicit conversion from the type receiving the method to a new type (typically, a class) that wraps the original type and provides the additional method. If a method cannot be found for a given type, the compiler automatically searches for any applicable implicit conversions to types that provide the method in question. This technique allows new methods to be added to an existing class using an add-on library such that only code that imports the add-on library gets the new functionality, and all other code is unaffected. The following example shows the enrichment of type Int with methods isEven and isOdd: object MyExtensions: extension (i: Int) def isEven = i % 2 == 0 def isOdd = !i.isEven import MyExtensions.* // bring implicit enrichment into scope 4.isEven // -> true Importing the members of MyExtensions brings the implicit conversion to extension class IntPredicates into scope.\",\n",
      "  \"concurrency\": \"Scala's standard library includes support for futures and promises, in addition to the standard Java concurrency APIs. Originally, it also included support for the actor model, which is now available as a separate source-available platform Akka licensed by Lightbend Inc. Akka actors may be distributed or combined with software transactional memory (transactors). Alternative communicating sequential processes (CSP) implementations for channel-based message passing are Communicating Scala Objects, or simply via JCSP. An Actor is like a thread instance with a mailbox. It can be created by system.actorOf, overriding the receive method to receive messages and using the ! (exclamation point) method to send a message. The following example shows an EchoServer that can receive messages and then print them. val echoServer = actor(new Act: become: case msg => println(echo  + msg) ) echoServer ! hi Scala also comes with built-in support for data-parallel programming in the form of Parallel Collections integrated into its Standard Library since version 2.9.0. The following example shows how to use Parallel Collections to improve performance. val urls = List(https://scala-lang.org, https://github.com/scala/scala) def fromURL(url: String) = scala.io.Source.fromURL(url) .getLines().mkString(\\\\n) val t = System.currentTimeMillis() urls.par.map(fromURL(_)) // par returns parallel implementation of a collection println(time:  + (System.currentTimeMillis - t) + ms) Besides futures and promises, actor support, and data parallelism, Scala also supports asynchronous programming with software transactional memory, and event streams.\",\n",

      "  \"comparison_with_other_jvm_languages\": \"Scala is often compared with Groovy and Clojure, two other programming languages also using the JVM. Substantial differences between these languages exist in the type system, in the extent to which each language supports object-oriented and functional programming, and in the similarity of their syntax to that of Java. Scala is statically typed, while both Groovy and Clojure are dynamically typed. This makes the type system more complex and difficult to understand but allows almost all type errors to be caught at compile-time and can result in significantly faster execution. By contrast, dynamic typing requires more testing to ensure program correctness, and thus is generally slower, to allow greater programming flexibility and simplicity. Regarding speed differences, current versions of Groovy and Clojure allow optional type annotations to help programs avoid the overhead of dynamic typing in cases where types are practically static. This overhead is further reduced when using recent versions of the JVM, which has been enhanced with an invoke dynamic instruction for methods that are defined with dynamically typed arguments. These advances reduce the speed gap between static and dynamic typing, although a statically typed language, like Scala, is still the preferred choice when execution efficiency is very important. Regarding programming paradigms, Scala inherits the object-oriented model of Java and extends it in various ways. Groovy, while also strongly object-oriented, is more focused in reducing verbosity. In Clojure, object-oriented programming is deemphasised with functional programming being the main strength of the language. Scala also has many functional programming facilities, including features found in advanced functional languages like Haskell, and tries to be agnostic between the two paradigms, letting the developer choose between the two paradigms or, more frequently, some combination thereof. Regarding syntax similarity with Java, Scala inherits much of Java's syntax, as is the case with Groovy. Clojure on the other hand follows the Lisp syntax, which is different in both appearance and philosophy.[citation needed]\",\n",
      "  \"language_rankings\": \"Back in 2013, when Scala was in version 2.10, the ThoughtWorks Technology Radar, which is an opinion based biannual report of a group of senior technologists, recommended Scala adoption in its languages and frameworks category. In July 2014, this assessment was made more specific and now refers to a “Scala, the good parts”, which is described as “To successfully use Scala, you need to research the language and have a very strong opinion on which parts are right for you, creating your own definition of Scala, the good parts.”. In the 2018 edition of the State of Java survey, which collected data from 5160 developers on various Java-related topics, Scala places third in terms of use of alternative languages on the JVM. Relative to the prior year's edition of the survey, Scala's use among alternative JVM languages fell from 28.4% to 21.5%, overtaken by Kotlin, which rose from 11.4% in 2017 to 28.8% in 2018. The Popularity of Programming Language Index, which tracks searches for language tutorials, ranked Scala 15th in April 2018 with a small downward trend, and 17th in Jan 2021. This makes Scala the 3rd most popular JVM-based language after Java and Kotlin, ranked 12th. The RedMonk Programming Language Rankings, which establishes rankings based on the number of GitHub projects and questions asked on Stack Overflow, in January 2021 ranked Scala 14th. Here, Scala was placed inside a second-tier group of languages–ahead of Go, PowerShell, and Haskell, and behind Swift, Objective-C, Typescript, and R. The TIOBE index of programming language popularity employs internet search engine rankings and similar publication counting to determine language popularity. In September 2021, it showed Scala in 31st place. In this ranking, Scala was ahead of Haskell (38th) and Erlang, but below Go (14th), Swift (15th), and Perl (19th). As of 2022[update], JVM-based languages such as Clojure, Groovy, and Scala are highly ranked, but still significantly less popular than the original Java language, which is usually ranked in the top three places.\",\n",

      "  \"goals\": \"The primary goal of Zig is to be a better solution to the sorts of tasks that are currently solved with C. A primary concern in that respect is readability; Zig attempts to use existing concepts and syntax wherever possible, avoiding the addition of different syntax for similar concepts. Further, it is designed for robustness, optimality and maintainability, including a variety of features to improve safety, optimization, and testing. The small and simple syntax is an important part of the maintenance, as it is a goal of the language to allow maintainers to debug the code without having to learn the intricacies of a language they might not be familiar with. Even with these changes, Zig can compile into and against existing C code; C headers can be included in a Zig project and their functions called, and Zig code can be linked into C projects by including the compiler-built headers. In keeping with the overall design philosophy of making the code simple and easy to read, the Zig system as a whole also encompasses a number of stylistic changes compared to C and other C-like languages. For instance, the Rust language has operator overloading which means a statement like a = b + c might actually be a function call to a type’s overloaded version of the plus operator. Further, that function might panic which might pre-empt any following code. In Zig, if something calls a function, it looks like a function call; if it doesn’t, it doesn’t look like a function call. If it can raise an error, it is explicit in the syntax, error handling is handled through error types and can be handled with catch or try. The goals of Zig are in contrast to those of many other languages designed in the same time period, like Go, Rust, Carbon, and Nim. Generally, these languages are more complex with added features like operator overloading, functions that masquerade as values (properties), and many other features intended to aid in building large programs. These sorts of features have more in common with C++’s approach, and these languages are more along the lines of that language. Zig has a more conservative extension of the type system, supporting compile time generics and accommodating a form of duck typing with the comptime directive.\",\n",
      "  \"memory_handling\": \"One of the primary sources of bugs in C programs is the memory management system, based on malloc. malloc sets aside a block of memory for use in the code and returns a reference to that memory as a pointer. There is no system to ensure that memory is released when the program no longer needs it, which can lead to programs using up all available memory, a memory leak. More common is a dangling pointer that does not refer to a properly allocated memory object. A common solution to these problems is a garbage collector (GC), which examines the program for pointers to previously allocated memory, and removing any blocks that no longer have anything pointing to them. Although this greatly reduces, or even eliminates, memory errors, GC systems are relatively slow compared to manual memory management[citation needed], and have unpredictable performance that makes them unsuited to systems programming. Another solution is automatic reference counting (ARC), which implements the same basic concept of identifying blocks of disused memory, but does so at pointer creation and destruction time by maintaining the number of pointers to a block, meaning there is no need to perform exhaustive pointer searches, which are rendered unnecessary at the cost of adding reference counter adjustment overhead to every pointer creation and destruction operation. Zig aims to provide performance similar to or better than C, so GC and ARC are not suitable solutions. Instead, it uses a modern, as of 2022[update], concept known as option types. Instead of a pointer being allowed to point to nothing, or nil, a separate type is used to indicate data that is optionally empty. This is similar to using a structure with a pointer and a boolean that indicates whether the pointer is valid, but the state of the boolean is invisibly managed by the language and does not need to be explicitly managed by the programmer. So, for instance, when the pointer is declared it is set to unallocated, and when that pointer receives a value from a malloc, it is set to allocated if the malloc succeeded. The advantage to this model is that it has very low or zero overhead; the compiler has to create the code to pass along the optional type when pointers are manipulated, as opposed to a simple pointer, but this allows it to directly express possible memory problems at compile time with no runtime support. For instance, creating a pointer with a null value and then attempting to use it is perfectly acceptable in C, leading to null-pointer errors. In contrast, a language using optional types can check that all code paths only attempt to use pointers when they are valid. While this does not eliminate all potential problems, when issues do occur at runtime the error can be more precisely located and explained. Another change for memory management in Zig is that the actual allocation is handled through structs describing the action, as opposed to calling the memory management functions in libc. For instance, in C if one wants to write a function that makes a string containing multiple copies of another string, the function might look like this: const char* repeat(const char* original, size_t times); In the code, the function would examine the size of original and then malloc times that length to set aside memory for the string it will build. That malloc is invisible to the functions calling it, if they fail to later release the memory, a leak will occur. In Zig, this might be handled using a function like: fn repeat(allocator: std.mem.Allocator, original: []const u8, times: usize) std.mem.Allocator.Error![]const u8; In this code, the allocator variable is passed a struct that describes what code should perform the allocation, and the repeat function returns either the resulting string or, using the optional type as indicated by the !, an Allocator.Error. By directly expressing the allocator as an input, memory allocation is never hidden within another function, it is always exposed to the API by the function that is ultimately calling for the memory to be allocated. No allocations are performed inside Zig’s standard library. Further, as the struct can point to anything, one can use alternative allocators, even ones written in the program. This can allow, for instance, small-object allocators that do not use the operating system functions that normally allocate an entire memory page. Optional types are an example of a language feature that offers general functionality while still being simple and generic. They do not have to be used to solve null pointer problems, they are also useful for any type of value where no value is an appropriate answer. Consider a function countTheNumberOfUsers that returns an integer, and an integer variable, theCountedUsers that holds the result. In many languages, a magic number would be placed in theCountedUsers to indicate that countTheNumberOfUsers has not yet been called, while many implementations would just set it to zero. In Zig, this could be implemented as an var theCountedUsers: ?i32 = null which sets the variable to a clear not been called value. Another more general feature of Zig that also helps manage memory problems is the concept of defer, which marks some code to be performed at the end of a function no matter what happens, including possible runtime errors. If a particular function allocates some memory and then disposes of it when the operation is complete, one can add a line to defer a free to ensure it is released no matter what happens. Zig memory management avoids hidden allocations. Allocation is not managed in the language directly. Instead, heap access is done via the standard library, explicitly.\",\n",
      "  \"direct_interaction_with_c\": \"Zig promotes a gradual approach to portability that combines new Zig code with existing C code. To do this, it aims to make interaction with existing C libraries as seamless as possible. Zig imports its own libraries with the @import directive, typically in this fashion: const std = @import(std); Zig code within that file can now call functions inside std, for instance: std.debug.print(Hello, world!\\\\n, .{}); To work with C code, one simply replaces the @import with @cImport: const c = @cImport(@cInclude(soundio/soundio.h)); The Zig code can now call functions in the soundio library as if they were native Zig code. As Zig uses new data types that are explicitly defined, unlike C’s more generic int and float, a small number of directives are used to move data between the C and Zig types, including @intCast and @ptrCast.\",\n",
      "  \"comptime\": \"By using the comptime keyword, the programmer can explicitly have Zig evaluate sections of code at compile time, as opposed to runtime. Being able to run code at compile time allows Zig to have the functionality of macros and conditional compilation without the need for a separate preprocessor language. During compile time, types become first-class citizens. This enables compile-time duck typing, and is how Zig implements generic types. For instance, in Zig, a generic linked list type might be implemented using a function like: fn LinkedList(comptime T: type) type; This function takes in some type T, and returns a custom struct defining a linked list with that data type.\",\n",
      "  \"compiler\": \"Zig also includes a C and C++ compiler, and can be used with either or both languages by leveraging with the commands zig cc and zig c++, providing many headers including the C standard library (libc) and C++ Standard Library (libcxx) for many different platforms. This allows Zig’s cc and c++ sub-commands to act as cross compilers out of the box (similarly to Clang). Zig treats cross-compiling as a first-class use-case of the language. This means any Zig compiler can compile runnable binaries for any of its target platforms, of which there are dozens. These include not only widely-used modern systems like ARM and x86-64, but also PowerPC, SPARC, MIPS, RISC-V, LoongArch64 and even the IBM z/Architectures (S390). The toolchain can compile to any of these targets without installing additional software, all the needed support is in the basic system. The experimental support is also provided for less known platforms like AMD and Nvidia GPUs or PlayStation 4 and 5 (with various degree of support). Cross-compilation is also available for variety of the operating systems (mostly desktop ones). Popular UNIX-like ones and Windows are officially supported (and documented), but (minimal) applications can and have been made for Android (with Android NDK) or iOS. Zig uses LLVM (written in C++) as a backend for optimization. Since version 0.10 the Zig compiler is written in the Zig programming language, i.e., it is a self-hosting compiler. The self-hosted linker is tightly coupled with the self-hosted compiler. The LLVM backend is the default for most targets, except for SPIR-V. Zig also supports their self-hosted backend which can be enabled by using -fno-llvm.\",\n",

Instead a package is simply a URL that points to a compressed file, or a Git repository.

      "  \"history\": \"James Strachan first talked about the development of Groovy on his blog in August 2003. In March 2004, Groovy was submitted to the JCP as JSR 241 and accepted by ballot. Several versions were released between 2004 and 2006. After the Java Community Process (JCP) standardization effort began, the version numbering changed, and a version called 1.0 was released on January 2, 2007. After various betas and release candidates numbered 1.1, on December 7, 2007, Groovy 1.1 Final was released and immediately renumbered as Groovy 1.5 to reflect the many changes made. In 2007, Groovy won the first prize at JAX 2007 innovation award. In 2008, Grails, a Groovy web framework, won the second prize at JAX 2008 innovation award. In November 2008, SpringSource acquired the Groovy and Grails company (G2One). In August 2009 VMware acquired SpringSource. In April 2012, after eight years of inactivity, the Spec Lead changed the status of JSR 241 to dormant. Strachan had left the project silently a year before the Groovy 1.0 release in 2007.[citation needed] In Oct 2016, Strachan stated I still love groovy (jenkins pipelines are so groovy!), java, go, typescript and kotlin. On July 2, 2012, Groovy 2.0 was released, which, among other new features, added static compiling and static type checking. When the Pivotal Software joint venture was spun-off by EMC Corporation (EMC) and VMware in April 2013, Groovy and Grails formed part of its product portfolio. Pivotal ceased sponsoring Groovy and Grails from April 2015. That same month, Groovy changed its governance structure from a Codehaus repository to a Project Management Committee (PMC) in the Apache Software Foundation via its incubator. Groovy graduated from Apache's incubator and became a top-level project in November 2015. On February 7, 2020, Groovy 3.0 was released. Version 4.0 was released on January 25, 2022.\",\n",
      "  \"features\": \"Most valid Java files are also valid Groovy files. Although the two languages are similar, Groovy code can be more compact, because it does not need all the elements that Java needs. This makes it possible for Java programmers to learn Groovy gradually by starting with familiar Java syntax before acquiring more Groovy programming idioms. Groovy features not available in Java include both static and dynamic typing (with the keyword def), operator overloading, native syntax for lists and associative arrays (maps), native support for regular expressions, polymorphic iteration, string interpolation, added helper methods, and the safe navigation operator ?. to check automatically for null pointers (for example, variable?.method(), or variable?.field). Since version 2, Groovy also supports modularity (shipping only the jars that the project uses, thus reducing the size of Groovy's library), type checking, static compilation, Project Coin syntax enhancements, multicatch blocks and ongoing performance enhancements using the invokedynamic instruction introduced in Java 7. Groovy natively supports markup languages such as XML and HTML by using an inline Document Object Model (DOM) syntax. This feature enables the definition and manipulation of many types of heterogeneous data assets with a uniform and concise syntax and programming methodology.[citation needed] Unlike Java, a Groovy source code file can be executed as an (uncompiled) script, if it contains code outside any class definition, if it is a class with a main method, or if it is a Runnable or GroovyTestCase. A Groovy script is fully parsed, compiled, and generated before executing (similar to Python and Ruby). This occurs under the hood, and the compiled version is not saved as an artifact of the process.\",\n",
      "  \"groovybeans_properties\": \"GroovyBeans are Groovy's version of JavaBeans. Groovy implicitly generates getters and setters. In the following code, setColor(String color) and getColor() are implicitly generated. The last two lines, which appear to access color directly, are actually calling the implicitly generated methods. class AGroovyBean { String color } def myGroovyBean = new AGroovyBean() myGroovyBean.setColor('baby blue') assert myGroovyBean.getColor() == 'baby blue' myGroovyBean.color = 'pewter' assert myGroovyBean.color == 'pewter' Groovy offers simple, consistent syntax for handling lists and maps, reminiscent of Java's array syntax. def movieList = ['Dersu Uzala', 'Ran', 'Seven Samurai'] // Looks like an array, but is a list assert movieList == 'Seven Samurai' movieList = 'Casablanca' // Adds an element to the list assert movieList.size() == 4 def monthMap = [ 'January' : 31, 'February' : 28, 'March' : 31 ] // Declares a map assert monthMap['March'] == 31 // Accesses an entry monthMap['April'] = 30 // Adds an entry to the map assert monthMap.size() == 4\",\n",
      "  \"prototype_extension\": \"Groovy offers support for prototype extension through ExpandoMetaClass, Extension Modules (only in Groovy 2), Objective-C-like Categories and DelegatingMetaClass. ExpandoMetaClass offers a domain-specific language (DSL) to express the changes in the class easily, similar to Ruby's open class concept: Number.metaClass { sqrt = { Math.sqrt(delegate) } } assert 9.sqrt() == 3 assert 4.sqrt() == 2 Groovy's changes in code through prototyping are not visible in Java, since each attribute/method invocation in Groovy goes through the metaclass registry. The changed code can only be accessed from Java by going to the metaclass registry. Groovy also allows overriding methods as getProperty(), propertyMissing() among others, enabling the developer to intercept calls to an object and specify an action for them, in a simplified aspect-oriented way. The following code enables the class java.lang.String to respond to the hex property: enum Color { BLACK('#000000'), WHITE('#FFFFFF'), RED('#FF0000'), BLUE('#0000FF') String hex Color(String hex) { this.hex = hex } } String.metaClass.getProperty = { String property -> def stringColor = delegate if (property == 'hex') { Color.values().find { it.name().equalsIgnoreCase stringColor }?.hex } } assert WHITE.hex == #FFFFFF assert BLUE.hex == #0000FF assert BLACK.hex == #000000 assert GREEN.hex == null The Grails framework uses metaprogramming extensively to enable GORM dynamic finders, like User.findByName('Josh') and others.\",\n",
      "  \"dot_and_parentheses\": \"Groovy's syntax permits omitting parentheses and dots in some situations. The following groovy code take(coffee).with(sugar, milk).and(liquor) can be written as take coffee with sugar, milk and liquor enabling the development of domain-specific languages (DSLs) that look like plain English.\",\n",
      "  \"functional_programming\": \"Although Groovy is mostly an object-oriented language, it also offers functional programming features.\",\n",
      "  \"closures\": \"According to Groovy's documentation: Closures in Groovy work similar to a 'method pointer', enabling code to be written and run in a later point in time. Groovy's closures support free variables, i.e. variables that have not been explicitly passed as a parameter to it, but exist in its declaration context, partial application (that it terms 'currying'), delegation, implicit, typed and untyped parameters. When working on Collections of a determined type, the closure passed to an operation on the collection can be inferred: list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9] /* * Non-zero numbers are coerced to true, so when it % 2 == 0 (even), it is false. * The type of the implicit it parameter can be inferred as an Integer by the IDE. * It could also be written as: * list.findAll { Integer i -> i % 2 } * list.findAll { i -> i % 2 } */ def odds = list.findAll { it % 2 } assert odds == [1, 3, 5, 7, 9] A group of expressions can be written in a closure block without reference to an implementation and the responding object can be assigned at a later point using delegation: // This block of code contains expressions without reference to an implementation def operations = { declare 5 sum 4 divide 3 print } /* * This class will handle the operations that can be used in the closure above. Another class * could be declared having the same methods, but using, for example, webservice operations * in the calculations. */ class Expression { BigDecimal value /* * Though an Integer is passed as a parameter, it is coerced into a BigDecimal, as was * defined. If the class had a 'declare(Integer value)' method, it would be used instead. */ def declare(BigDecimal value) { this.value = value } def sum(BigDecimal valueToAdd) { this.value += valueToAdd } def divide(BigDecimal divisor) { this.value /= divisor } def propertyMissing(String property) { if (property == print) println value } } // Here is defined who is going to respond the expressions in the block of code above. operations.delegate = new Expression() operations()\",\n",
      "  \"curry\": \"Usually called partial application, this Groovy feature allows closures' parameters to be set to a default parameter in any of their arguments, creating a new closure with the bound value. Supplying one argument to the curry() method will fix argument one. Supplying N arguments will fix arguments 1 .. N. def joinTwoWordsWithSymbol = { symbol, first, second -> first + symbol + second } assert joinTwoWordsWithSymbol('#', 'Hello', 'World') == 'Hello#World' def concatWords = joinTwoWordsWithSymbol.curry(' ') assert concatWords('Hello', 'World') == 'Hello World' def prependHello = concatWords.curry('Hello') //def prependHello = joinTwoWordsWithSymbol.curry(' ', 'Hello') assert prependHello('World') == 'Hello World' Curry can also be used in the reverse direction (fixing the last N arguments) using rcurry(). def power = { BigDecimal value, BigDecimal power -> value**power } def square = power.rcurry(2) def cube = power.rcurry(3) assert power(2, 2) == 4 assert square(4) == 16 assert cube(3) == 27 Groovy also supports lazy evaluation, reduce/fold, infinite structures and immutability, among others.\",\n",
      "  \"json_and_xml_processing\": \"On JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) and XML processing, Groovy employs the Builder pattern, making the production of the data structure less verbose. For example, the following XML: <languages> <language year=1995> <name>Java</name> <paradigm>object oriented</paradigm> <typing>static</typing> </language> <language year=1995> <name>Ruby</name> <paradigm>functional, object oriented</paradigm> <typing>duck typing, dynamic</typing> </language> <language year=2003> <name>Groovy</name> <paradigm>functional, object oriented</paradigm> <typing>duck typing, dynamic, static</typing> </language> </languages> can be generated via the following Groovy code: def writer = new StringWriter() def builder = new groovy.xml.MarkupBuilder(writer) builder.languages { language(year: 1995) { name Java paradigm object oriented typing static } language (year: 1995) { name Ruby paradigm functional, object oriented typing duck typing, dynamic } language (year: 2003) { name Groovy paradigm functional, object oriented typing duck typing, dynamic, static } } and also can be processed in a streaming way through StreamingMarkupBuilder. To change the implementation to JSON, the MarkupBuilder can be swapped to JsonBuilder. To parse it and search for a functional language, Groovy's findAll method can serve: def languages = new XmlSlurper().parseText writer.toString() // Here is employed Groovy's regex syntax for a matcher (=~) that will be coerced to a // boolean value: either true, if the value contains our string, or false otherwise. def functional = languages.language.findAll { it.paradigm =~ functional } assert functional.collect { it.name } == [Groovy, Ruby]\",\n",
      "  \"string_interpolation\": \"In Groovy, strings can be interpolated with variables and expressions by using GStrings: BigDecimal account = 10.0 def text = The account shows currently a balance of $account assert text == The account shows currently a balance of 10.0 GStrings containing variables and expressions must be declared using double quotes. A complex expression must be enclosed in curly brackets. This prevents parts of it from being interpreted as belonging to the surrounding string instead of to the expression: BigDecimal minus = 4.0 text = The account shows currently a balance of ${account - minus} assert text == The account shows currently a balance of 6.0 // Without the brackets to isolate the expression, this would result: text = The account shows currently a balance of $account - minus assert text == The account shows currently a balance of 10.0 - minus Expression evaluation can be deferred by employing arrow syntax: BigDecimal tax = 0.15 text = The account shows currently a balance of ${->account - account*tax} tax = 0.10 // The tax value was changed AFTER declaration of the GString. The expression // variables are bound only when the expression must actually be evaluated: assert text == The account shows currently a balance of 9.000\",\n",
      "  \"abstract_syntax_tree_transformation\": \"According to Groovy's own documentation, When the Groovy compiler compiles Groovy scripts and classes, at some point in the process, the source code will end up being represented in memory in the form of a Concrete Syntax Tree, then transformed into an Abstract Syntax Tree. The purpose of AST Transformations is to let developers hook into the compilation process to be able to modify the AST before it is turned into bytecode that will be run by the JVM. AST Transformations provides Groovy with improved compile-time metaprogramming capabilities allowing powerful flexibility at the language level, without a runtime performance penalty. Examples of ASTs in Groovy are: Category and Mixin transformation Immutable AST Macro Newify transformation Singleton transformation among others. The testing framework Spock uses AST transformations to allow the programmer to write tests in a syntax not supported by Groovy, but the relevant code is then manipulated in the AST to valid code. An example of such a test is: def maximum of #a and #b is #c () { expect: Math.max (a, b) == c where: a | b || c 3 | 5 || 5 7 | 0 || 7 0 | 0 || 0 }\",\n",
      "  \"traits\": \"According to Groovy's documentation, Traits are a structural construct of the language that allows: composition of behaviors, runtime implementation of interfaces, behavior overriding, and compatibility with static type checking/compilation. Traits can be seen as interfaces carrying both default implementations and state. A trait is defined using the trait keyword: trait FlyingAbility { /* declaration of a trait */ String fly() { I'm flying! } /* declaration of a method inside a trait */ } Then, it can be used like a normal interface using the keyword implements: class Bird implements FlyingAbility {} /* Adds the trait FlyingAbility to the Bird class capabilities */ def bird = new Bird() /* instantiate a new Bird */ assert bird.fly() == I'm flying! /* the Bird class automatically gets the behavior of the FlyingAbility trait */ Traits allow a wide range of abilities, from simple composition to testing.\",\n",

      "  \"early_concept\": \"According to Matsumoto, Ruby was conceived in 1993. In a 1999 post to the Ruby-Talk mailing list, he shared some of his early ideas about the language: I was talking with my colleague about the possibility of an object-oriented scripting language. I knew Perl (Perl4, not Perl5), but I didn't like it really, because it had the smell of a toy language (it still has). The object-oriented language seemed very promising. I knew Python then. But I didn't like it, because I didn't think it was a true object-oriented language – OO features appeared to be add-on to the language. As a language maniac and OO fan for 15 years, I really wanted a genuine object-oriented, easy-to-use scripting language. I looked for but couldn't find one. So I decided to make it. Matsumoto described Ruby's design as resembling a simple Lisp language at its core, with an object system like that of Smalltalk, blocks inspired by higher-order functions, and practical utility like that of Perl. The name Ruby originated during an online chat session between Matsumoto and Keiju Ishitsuka on 24 February 1993, before any code had been written. Two names were initially proposed: Coral and Ruby. Matsumoto chose the latter in a subsequent email to Ishitsuka. He also noted that one factor influencing the choice of the name was that a colleague's birthstone was ruby.\",\n",
      "  \"early_releases\": \"The first public release of Ruby 0.95 was announced on Japanese domestic newsgroups on 21 December 1995. Subsequently, three more versions of Ruby were released in two days. The release coincided with the launch of the Japanese-language ruby-list mailing list, which was the first mailing list for the new language. Already present at this stage of development were many of the features familiar in later releases of Ruby, including object-oriented design, classes with inheritance, mixins, iterators, closures, exception handling and garbage collection. After the release of Ruby 0.95 in 1995, several stable versions of Ruby were released in these years. In 1997, the first article about Ruby was published on the Web. In the same year, Matsumoto was hired by netlab.jp to work on Ruby as a full-time developer. In 1998, the Ruby Application Archive was launched by Matsumoto, along with a simple English-language homepage for Ruby. In 1999, the first English language mailing list ruby-talk began, which signaled a growing interest in the language outside Japan. In this same year, Matsumoto and Keiju Ishitsuka wrote the first book on Ruby, The Object-oriented Scripting Language Ruby (オブジェクト指向スクリプト言語 Ruby), which was published in Japan in October 1999. It would be followed in the early 2000s by around 20 books on Ruby published in Japanese. By 2000, Ruby was more popular than Python in Japan. In September 2000, the first English language book Programming Ruby was printed, which was later freely released to the public, further widening the adoption of Ruby amongst English speakers. In early 2002, the English-language ruby-talk mailing list was receiving more messages than the Japanese-language ruby-list, demonstrating Ruby's increasing popularity in the non-Japanese speaking world.\",\n",
      "  \"ruby__and_\": \"Ruby 1.8 was initially released August 2003, was stable for a long time, and was retired June 2013. Although deprecated, there is still code based on it. Ruby 1.8 is only partially compatible with Ruby 1.9.[citation needed] Ruby 1.8 has been the subject of several industry standards. The language specifications for Ruby were developed by the Open Standards Promotion Center of the Information-Technology Promotion Agency (a Japanese government agency) for submission to the Japanese Industrial Standards Committee (JISC) and then to the International Organization for Standardization (ISO). It was accepted as a Japanese Industrial Standard (JIS X 3017) in 2011 and an international standard (ISO/IEC 30170) in 2012. Ruby on Rails logo Around 2005, interest in the Ruby language surged in tandem with Ruby on Rails, a web framework written in Ruby. Rails is frequently credited with increasing awareness of Ruby. Effective with Ruby 1.9.3, released 31 October 2011, Ruby switched from being dual-licensed under the Ruby License and the GPL to being dual-licensed under the Ruby License and the two-clause BSD license. Adoption of 1.9 was slowed by changes from 1.8 that required many popular third party gems to be rewritten.[citation needed]\",\n",
      "  \"ruby_\": \"Ruby 3.0.0 was released on Christmas Day in 2020. It is known as Ruby 3x3, which signifies that programs would run three times faster in Ruby 3.0 comparing to Ruby 2.0. and some had already implemented in intermediate releases on the road from 2 to 3. To achieve 3x3, Ruby 3 comes with MJIT, and later YJIT, Just-In-Time Compilers, to make programs faster, although they are described as experimental and remain disabled by default (enabled by flags at runtime). Another goal of Ruby 3.0 is to improve concurrency and two more utilities Fibre Scheduler, and experimental Ractor facilitate the goal. Ractor is light-weight and thread-safe as it is achieved by exchanging messages rather than shared objects. Ruby 3.0 introduces RBS language to describe the types of Ruby programs for static analysis. It is separated from general Ruby programs. There are some syntax enhancements and library changes in Ruby 3.0 as well. Ruby 3.1 was released on 25 December 2021. It includes YJIT, a new, experimental, Just-In-Time Compiler developed by Shopify, to enhance the performance of real world business applications. A new debugger is also included. There are some syntax enhancements and other improvements in this release. Network libraries for FTP, SMTP, IMAP, and POP are moved from default gems to bundled gems. Ruby 3.2 was released on 25 December 2022. It brings support for being run inside of a WebAssembly environment via a WASI interface. Regular expressions also receives some improvements, including a faster, memoized matching algorithm to protect against certain ReDoS attacks, and configurable timeouts for regular expression matching. Additional debugging and syntax features are also included in this release, which include syntax suggestion, as well as error highlighting. The MJIT compiler has been re-implemented as a standard library module, while the YJIT, a Rust-based JIT compiler now supports more architectures on Linux. Ruby 3.3 was released on 25 December 2023. Ruby 3.3 introduces significant enhancements and performance improvements to the language. Key features include the introduction of the Prism parser for portable and maintainable parsing, the addition of the pure-Ruby JIT compiler RJIT, and major performance boosts in the YJIT compiler. Additionally, improvements in memory usage, the introduction of an M:N thread scheduler, and updates to the standard library contribute to a more efficient and developer-friendly Ruby ecosystem. Ruby 3.4 was released on 25 December 2024. Ruby 3.4 adds it block parameter reference, changes Prism as default parser, adds Happy Eyeballs Version 2 support to socket library, improves YJIT, adds modular Garbage Collector and so on.\",\n",
      "  \"semantics_and_philosophy\": \"Yukihiro Matsumoto, the creator of Ruby Matsumoto has said that Ruby is designed for programmer productivity and fun, following the principles of good user interface design. At a Google Tech Talk in 2008 he said, I hope to see Ruby help every programmer in the world to be productive, and to enjoy programming, and to be happy. That is the primary purpose of Ruby language. He stresses that systems design needs to emphasize human, rather than computer, needs: Often people, especially computer engineers, focus on the machines. They think, By doing this, the machine will run fast. By doing this, the machine will run more effectively. By doing this, the machine will something something something. They are focusing on machines. But in fact we need to focus on humans, on how humans care about doing programming or operating the application of the machines. We are the masters. They are the slaves. Matsumoto has said his primary design goal was to make a language that he himself enjoyed using, by minimizing programmer work and possible confusion. He has said that he had not applied the principle of least astonishment (POLA) to the design of Ruby; in a May 2005 discussion on the newsgroup comp.lang.ruby, Matsumoto attempted to distance Ruby from POLA, explaining that because any design choice will be surprising to someone, he uses a personal standard in evaluating surprise. If that personal standard remains consistent, there would be few surprises for those familiar with the standard. Matsumoto defined it this way in an interview: Everyone has an individual background. Someone may come from Python, someone else may come from Perl, and they may be surprised by different aspects of the language. Then they come up to me and say, 'I was surprised by this feature of the language, so Ruby violates the principle of least surprise.' Wait. Wait. The principle of least surprise is not for you only. The principle of least surprise means principle of least my surprise. And it means the principle of least surprise after you learn Ruby very well. For example, I was a C++ programmer before I started designing Ruby. I programmed in C++ exclusively for two or three years. And after two years of C++ programming, it still surprises me. Ruby is object-oriented: every value is an object, including classes and instances of types that many other languages designate as primitives (such as integers, Booleans, and null). Because everything in Ruby is an object, everything in Ruby has certain built-in abilities called methods. Every function is a method and methods are always called on an object. Methods defined at the top level scope become methods of the Object class. Since this class is an ancestor of every other class, such methods can be called on any object. They are also visible in all scopes, effectively serving as global procedures. Ruby supports inheritance with dynamic dispatch, mixins and singleton methods (belonging to, and defined for, a single instance rather than being defined on the class). Though Ruby does not support multiple inheritance, classes can import modules as mixins. Ruby has been described as a multi-paradigm programming language: it allows procedural programming (defining functions/variables outside classes makes them part of the root, 'self' Object), with object orientation (everything is an object) or functional programming (it has anonymous functions, closures, and continuations; statements all have values, and functions return the last evaluation). It has support for introspection, reflective programming, metaprogramming, and interpreter-based threads. Ruby features dynamic typing, and supports parametric polymorphism. According to the Ruby FAQ, the syntax is similar to Perl's and the semantics are similar to Smalltalk's, but the design philosophy differs greatly from Python's.\",\n",
      "  \"features\": \"Thoroughly object-oriented with inheritance, mixins and metaclasses Dynamic typing and duck typing Everything is an expression (even statements) and everything is executed imperatively (even declarations) Succinct and flexible syntax that minimizes syntactic noise and serves as a foundation for domain-specific languages Dynamic reflection and alteration of objects to facilitate metaprogramming Lexical closures, iterators and generators, with a block syntax Literal notation for arrays, hashes, regular expressions and symbols Embedding code in strings (interpolation) Default arguments Four levels of variable scope (global, class, instance, and local) denoted by sigils or the lack thereof Garbage collection First-class continuations Strict Boolean coercion rules (everything is true except false and nil) Exception handling Operator overloading Built-in support for rational numbers, complex numbers and arbitrary-precision arithmetic Custom dispatch behavior (through method_missing and const_missing) Native threads and cooperative fibers (fibers are a 1.9/YARV feature) Support for Unicode and multiple character encodings.

      "  \"syntax\": \"Main article: Ruby syntax The syntax of Ruby is broadly similar to that of Perl and Python. Class and method definitions are signaled by keywords, whereas code blocks can be defined by either keywords or braces. In contrast to Perl, variables are not obligatorily prefixed with a sigil. When used, the sigil changes the semantics of scope of the variable. For practical purposes there is no distinction between expressions and statements. Line breaks are significant and taken as the end of a statement; a semicolon may be equivalently used. Unlike Python, indentation is not significant. One of the differences from Python and Perl is that Ruby keeps all of its instance variables completely private to the class and only exposes them through accessor methods (attr_writer, attr_reader, etc.). Unlike the getter and setter methods of other languages like C++ or Java, accessor methods in Ruby can be created with a single line of code via metaprogramming; however, accessor methods can also be created in the traditional fashion of C++ and Java. As invocation of these methods does not require the use of parentheses, it is trivial to change an instance variable into a full function, without modifying a single line of calling code or having to do any refactoring achieving similar functionality to C# and VB.NET property members. Python's property descriptors are similar, but come with a trade-off in the development process. If one begins in Python by using a publicly exposed instance variable, and later changes the implementation to use a private instance variable exposed through a property descriptor, code internal to the class may need to be adjusted to use the private variable rather than the public property. Ruby's design forces all instance variables to be private, but also provides a simple way to declare set and get methods. This is in keeping with the idea that in Ruby, one never directly accesses the internal members of a class from outside the class; rather, one passes a message to the class and receives a response.\",\n",

(April 2025) As of 2018[update], there are a number of alternative implementations of Ruby, including JRuby, Rubinius, and mruby. Each takes a different approach, with JRuby and Rubinius providing just-in-time compilation and mruby also providing ahead-of-time compilation. Ruby has three major alternative implementations: JRuby, a mixed Java and Ruby implementation that runs on the Java virtual machine. JRuby currently targets Ruby 3.1.x. TruffleRuby, a Java implementation using the Truffle language implementation framework with GraalVM Rubinius, a C++ bytecode virtual machine that uses LLVM to compile to machine code at runtime. The bytecode compiler and most core classes are written in pure Ruby. Rubinius currently[when?] targets Ruby 2.3.1. Other Ruby implementations include: MagLev, a Smalltalk implementation that runs on GemTalk Systems' GemStone/S VM mruby, an implementation designed to be embedded into C code, in a similar vein to Lua. It is currently being developed by Yukihiro Matsumoto and others RGSS, or Ruby Game Scripting System, a proprietary implementation that is used by the RPG Maker series of software for game design and modification of the RPG Maker engine julializer, a transpiler (partial) from Ruby to Julia. It can be used for a large speedup over e.g. Ruby or JRuby implementations (may only be useful for numerical code). Topaz, a Ruby implementation written in Python Opal, a web-based interpreter that compiles Ruby to JavaScript Other now defunct Ruby implementations were: MacRuby, a Mac OS X implementation on the Objective-C runtime. Its iOS counterpart is called RubyMotion IronRuby an implementation on the .NET Framework Cardinal, an implementation for the Parrot virtual machine Ruby Enterprise Edition, often shortened to ree, an implementation optimized to handle large-scale Ruby on Rails projects HotRuby, a JavaScript and ActionScript implementation of the Ruby programming language The maturity of Ruby implementations tends to be measured by their ability to run the Ruby on Rails (Rails) framework, because it is complex to implement and uses many Ruby-specific features.

Of course, it also greatly benefited from the experiences hard-won by many other languages in the field, drawing ideas from Objective-C, Rust, Haskell, Ruby, Python, C#, CLU, and far too many others to list. ^ About Ruby.

      "  \"history\": \"See also: Java (software platform) § History Duke, the Java mascot James Gosling, the creator of Java, in 2008 James Gosling, Mike Sheridan, and Patrick Naughton initiated the Java language project in June 1991. Java was originally designed for interactive television, but it was too advanced for the digital cable television industry at the time. The language was initially called Oak after an oak tree that stood outside Gosling's office. Later the project went by the name Green and was finally renamed Java, from Java coffee, a type of coffee from Indonesia. Gosling designed Java with a C/C++-style syntax that system and application programmers would find familiar. Sun Microsystems released the first public implementation as Java 1.0 in 1996. It promised write once, run anywhere (WORA) functionality, providing no-cost run-times on popular platforms. Fairly secure and featuring configurable security, it allowed network- and file-access restrictions. Major web browsers soon incorporated the ability to run Java applets within web pages, and Java quickly became popular. The Java 1.0 compiler was re-written in Java by Arthur van Hoff to comply strictly with the Java 1.0 language specification. With the advent of Java 2 (released initially as J2SE 1.2 in December 1998 – 1999), new versions had multiple configurations built for different types of platforms. J2EE included technologies and APIs for enterprise applications typically run in server environments, while J2ME featured APIs optimized for mobile applications. The desktop version was renamed J2SE. In 2006, for marketing purposes, Sun renamed new J2 versions as Java EE, Java ME, and Java SE, respectively. In 1997, Sun Microsystems approached the ISO/IEC JTC 1 standards body and later the Ecma International to formalize Java, but it soon withdrew from the process. Java remains a de facto standard, controlled through the Java Community Process. At one time, Sun made most of its Java implementations available without charge, despite their proprietary software status. Sun generated revenue from Java through the selling of licenses for specialized products such as the Java Enterprise System. On November 13, 2006, Sun released much of its Java virtual machine (JVM) as free and open-source software (FOSS), under the terms of the GPL-2.0-only license. On May 8, 2007, Sun finished the process, making all of its JVM's core code available under free software/open-source distribution terms, aside from a small portion of code to which Sun did not hold the copyright. Sun's vice-president Rich Green said that Sun's ideal role with regard to Java was as an evangelist. Following Oracle Corporation's acquisition of Sun Microsystems in 2009–10, Oracle has described itself as the steward of Java technology with a relentless commitment to fostering a community of participation and transparency. This did not prevent Oracle from filing a lawsuit against Google shortly after that for using Java inside the Android SDK (see the Android section). On April 2, 2010, James Gosling resigned from Oracle. In January 2016, Oracle announced that Java run-time environments based on JDK 9 will discontinue the browser plugin. Java software runs on most devices from laptops to data centers, game consoles to scientific supercomputers. Oracle (and others) highly recommend uninstalling outdated and unsupported versions of Java, due to unresolved security issues in older versions.\",\n",
      "  \"principles\": \"There were five primary goals in creating the Java language: It must be simple, object-oriented, and familiar. It must be robust and secure. It must be architecture-neutral and portable. It must execute with high performance. It must be interpreted, threaded, and dynamic.\",\n",
      "  \"versions\": \"Main article: Java version history As of November 2024[update], Java 8, 11, 17, and 21 are supported as long-term support (LTS) versions, with Java 25, releasing in September 2025, as the next scheduled LTS version.

      "  \"java_jvm_and_bytecode\": \"Main articles: Java (software platform) and Java virtual machine One design goal of Java is portability, which means that programs written for the Java platform must run similarly on any combination of hardware and operating system with adequate run time support. This is achieved by compiling the Java language code to an intermediate representation called Java bytecode, instead of directly to architecture-specific machine code. Java bytecode instructions are analogous to machine code, but they are intended to be executed by a virtual machine (VM) written specifically for the host hardware. End-users commonly use a Java Runtime Environment (JRE) installed on their device for standalone Java applications or a web browser for Java applets. Standard libraries provide a generic way to access host-specific features such as graphics, threading, and networking. The use of universal bytecode makes porting simple. However, the overhead of interpreting bytecode into machine instructions made interpreted programs almost always run more slowly than native executables. Just-in-time (JIT) compilers that compile byte-codes to machine code during runtime were introduced from an early stage. Java's Hotspot compiler is actually two compilers in one; and with GraalVM (included in e.g. Java 11, but removed as of Java 16) allowing tiered compilation. Java itself is platform-independent and is adapted to the particular platform it is to run on by a Java virtual machine (JVM), which translates the Java bytecode into the platform's machine language.\",\n",
      "  \"performance\": \"Main article: Java performance Programs written in Java have a reputation for being slower and requiring more memory than those written in C++. However, Java programs' execution speed improved significantly with the introduction of just-in-time compilation in 1997/1998 for Java 1.1, the addition of language features supporting better code analysis (such as inner classes, the StringBuilder class, optional assertions, etc.), and optimizations in the Java virtual machine, such as HotSpot becoming Sun's default JVM in 2000. With Java 1.5, the performance was improved with the addition of the java.util.concurrent package, including lock-free implementations of the ConcurrentMaps and other multi-core collections, and it was improved further with Java 1.6.\",\n",
      "  \"non_jvm\": \"Some platforms offer direct hardware support for Java; there are micro controllers that can run Java bytecode in hardware instead of a software Java virtual machine, and some ARM-based processors could have hardware support for executing Java bytecode through their Jazelle option, though support has mostly been dropped in current implementations of ARM.\",\n",
      "  \"automatic_memory_management\": \"Java uses an automatic garbage collector to manage memory in the object lifecycle. The programmer determines when objects are created, and the Java runtime is responsible for recovering the memory once objects are no longer in use. Once no references to an object remain, the unreachable memory becomes eligible to be freed automatically by the garbage collector. Something similar to a memory leak may still occur if a programmer's code holds a reference to an object that is no longer needed, typically when objects that are no longer needed are stored in containers that are still in use. If methods for a non-existent object are called, a null pointer exception is thrown. One of the ideas behind Java's automatic memory management model is that programmers can be spared the burden of having to perform manual memory management. In some languages, memory for the creation of objects is implicitly allocated on the stack or explicitly allocated and deallocated from the heap. In the latter case, the responsibility of managing memory resides with the programmer. If the program does not deallocate an object, a memory leak occurs. If the program attempts to access or deallocate memory that has already been deallocated, the result is undefined and difficult to predict, and the program is likely to become unstable or crash. This can be partially remedied by the use of smart pointers, but these add overhead and complexity. Garbage collection does not prevent logical memory leaks, i.e. those where the memory is still referenced but never used. Garbage collection may happen at any time. Ideally, it will occur when a program is idle. It is guaranteed to be triggered if there is insufficient free memory on the heap to allocate a new object; this can cause a program to stall momentarily. Explicit memory management is not possible in Java. Java does not support C/C++ style pointer arithmetic, where object addresses can be arithmetically manipulated (e.g. by adding or subtracting an offset). This allows the garbage collector to relocate referenced objects and ensures type safety and security. As in C++ and some other object-oriented languages, variables of Java's primitive data types are either stored directly in fields (for objects) or on the stack (for methods) rather than on the heap, as is commonly true for non-primitive data types (but see escape analysis). This was a conscious decision by Java's designers for performance reasons. Java contains multiple types of garbage collectors. Since Java 9, HotSpot uses the Garbage First Garbage Collector (G1GC) as the default. However, there are also several other garbage collectors that can be used to manage the heap, such as the Z Garbage Collector (ZGC) introduced in Java 11, and Shenandoah GC, introduced in Java 12 but unavailable in Oracle-produced OpenJDK builds. Shenandoah is instead available in third-party builds of OpenJDK, such as Eclipse Temurin. For most applications in Java, G1GC is sufficient. In prior versions of Java, such as Java 8, the Parallel Garbage Collector was used as the default garbage collector. Having solved the memory management problem does not relieve the programmer of the burden of handling properly other kinds of resources, like network or database connections, file handles, etc., especially in the presence of exceptions.\",\n",
      "  \"syntax\": \"Main article: Java syntax This dependency graph of the Java Core classes was created with jdeps and Gephi. The syntax of Java is largely influenced by C++ and C. Unlike C++, which combines the syntax for structured, generic, and object-oriented programming, Java was built almost exclusively as an object-oriented language. All code is written inside classes, and every data item is an object, with the exception of the primitive data types, (i.e. integers, floating-point numbers, boolean values, and characters), which are not objects for performance reasons. Java reuses some popular aspects of C++ (such as the printf method). Unlike C++, Java does not support operator overloading or multiple inheritance for classes, though multiple inheritance is supported for interfaces. Java uses comments similar to those of C++. There are three different styles of comments: a single line style marked with two slashes (//), a multiple line style opened with /* and closed with */, and the Javadoc commenting style opened with /** and closed with */. The Javadoc style of commenting allows the user to run the Javadoc executable to create documentation for the program and can be read by some integrated development environments (IDEs) such as Eclipse to allow developers to access documentation within the IDE.\",\n",

The Java servlet API has to some extent been superseded (but still used under the hood) by two standard Java technologies for web services: the Java API for RESTful Web Services (JAX-RS 2.0) useful for AJAX, JSON and REST services, and the Java API for XML Web Services (JAX-WS) useful for SOAP Web Services.

Prior to the introduction of generics, each variable declaration had to be of a specific type. For container classes, for example, this is a problem because there is no easy way to create a container that accepts only specific types of objects. Either the container operates on all subtypes of a class or interface, usually Object, or a different container class has to be created for each contained class. Generics allow compile-time type checking without having to create many container classes, each containing almost identical code. In addition to enabling more efficient code, certain runtime exceptions are prevented from occurring, by issuing compile-time errors. If Java prevented all runtime type errors (ClassCastExceptions) from occurring, it would be type safe. In 2016, the type system of Java was proven unsound in that it is possible to use generics to construct classes and methods that allow assignment of an instance of one class to a variable of another unrelated class. Such code is accepted by the compiler, but fails at run time with a class cast exception.\",\n",

This implementation is based on the original implementation of Java by Sun. The Oracle implementation is available for Windows, macOS, Linux, and Solaris. Because Java lacks any formal standardization recognized by Ecma International, ISO/IEC, ANSI, or other third-party standards organizations, the Oracle implementation is the de facto standard. The Oracle implementation is packaged into two different distributions: The Java Runtime Environment (JRE) which contains the parts of the Java SE platform required to run Java programs and is intended for end users, and the Java Development Kit (JDK), which is intended for software developers and includes development tools such as the Java compiler, Javadoc, Jar, and a debugger. Oracle has also released GraalVM, a high performance Java dynamic compiler and interpreter. OpenJDK is another Java SE implementation that is licensed under the GNU GPL. The implementation started when Sun began releasing the Java source code under the GPL. As of Java SE 7, OpenJDK is the official Java reference implementation. The goal of Java is to make all implementations of Java compatible. Historically, Sun's trademark license for usage of the Java brand insists that all implementations be compatible. This resulted in a legal dispute with Microsoft after Sun claimed that the Microsoft implementation did not support Java remote method invocation (RMI) or Java Native Interface (JNI) and had added platform-specific features of their own. Sun sued in 1997, and, in 2001, won a settlement of US$20 million, as well as a court order enforcing the terms of the license from Sun. As a result, Microsoft no longer ships Java with Windows. Platform-independent Java is essential to Java EE, and an even more rigorous validation is required to certify an implementation. This environment enables portable server-side applications.\",\n",

Depending on the Android version, the bytecode is either interpreted by the Dalvik virtual machine or compiled into native code by the Android Runtime.

District Judge William Alsup ruled on May 31, 2012, that APIs cannot be copyrighted, but this was reversed by the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in May 2014. On May 26, 2016, the district court decided in favor of Google, ruling the copyright infringement of the Java API in Android constitutes fair use. In March 2018, this ruling was overturned by the Appeals Court, which sent down the case of determining the damages to federal court in San Francisco. Google filed a petition for writ of certiorari with the Supreme Court of the United States in January 2019 to challenge the two rulings that were made by the Appeals Court in Oracle's favor. On April 5, 2021, the Court ruled 6–2 in Google's favor, that its use of Java APIs should be considered fair use. However, the court refused to rule on the copyrightability of APIs, choosing instead to determine their ruling by considering Java's API copyrightable purely for argument's sake.\",\n",
