      "  \"history\": \"Go was designed at Google in 2007 to improve programming productivity in an era of multicore, networked machines and large codebases. The designers wanted to address criticisms of other languages in use at Google, but keep their useful characteristics: Static typing and run-time efficiency (like C) Readability and usability (like Python) High-performance networking and multiprocessing Its designers were primarily motivated by their shared dislike of C++. Go was publicly announced in November 2009, and version 1.0 was released in March 2012. Go is widely used in production at Google and in many other organizations and open-source projects. In retrospect the Go authors judged Go to be successful due to the overall engineering work around the language, including the runtime support for the language's concurrency feature. Although the design of most languages concentrates on innovations in syntax, semantics, or typing, Go is focused on the software development process itself. ... The principal unusual property of the language itself—concurrency—addressed problems that arose with the proliferation of multicore CPUs in the 2010s. But more significant was the early work that established fundamentals for packaging, dependencies, build, test, deployment, and other workaday tasks of the software development world, aspects that are not usually foremost in language design.\",\n",
      "  \"branding_and_styling\": \"Mascot of Go programming language is the Gopher shown above. The Gopher mascot was introduced in 2009 for the open source launch of the language. The design, by Renée French, borrowed from a c. 2000 WFMU promotion. In November 2016, the Go and Go Mono fonts were released by type designers Charles Bigelow and Kris Holmes specifically for use by the Go project. Go is a humanist sans-serif resembling Lucida Grande, and Go Mono is monospaced. Both fonts adhere to the WGL4 character set and were designed to be legible with a large x-height and distinct letterforms. Both Go and Go Mono adhere to the DIN 1450 standard by having a slashed zero, lowercase l with a tail, and an uppercase I with serifs. In April 2018, the original logo was redesigned by brand designer Adam Smith. The new logo is a modern, stylized GO slanting right with trailing streamlines. (The Gopher mascot remained the same.)\",\n",
      "  \"generics\": \"The lack of support for generic programming in initial versions of Go drew considerable criticism. The designers expressed an openness to generic programming and noted that built-in functions were in fact type-generic, but are treated as special cases; Pike called this a weakness that might be changed at some point. The Google team built at least one compiler for an experimental Go dialect with generics, but did not release it. In August 2018, the Go principal contributors published draft designs for generic programming and error handling and asked users to submit feedback. However, the error handling proposal was eventually abandoned. In June 2020, a new draft design document was published that would add the necessary syntax to Go for declaring generic functions and types. A code translation tool, go2go, was provided to allow users to try the new syntax, along with a generics-enabled version of the online Go Playground. Generics were finally added to Go in version 1.18 on March 15, 2022.\",\n",
      "  \"versioning\": \"Go 1 guarantees compatibility for the language specification and major parts of the standard library. All versions up through the current Go 1.24 release have maintained this promise. Go uses a go1.[major].[patch] versioning format, such as go1.24.0 and each major Go release is supported until there are two newer major releases. Unlike most software, Go calls the second number in a version the major, i.e., in go1.24.0 the 24 is the major version. This is because Go plans to never reach 2.0, prioritizing backwards compatibility over potential breaking changes.\",\n",
      "  \"design\": \"2015 lecture of Rob Pike (one of the Go creators) Go is influenced by C (especially the Plan 9 dialect[failed verification – see discussion]), but with an emphasis on greater simplicity and safety. It consists of: A syntax and environment adopting patterns more common in dynamic languages: Optional concise variable declaration and initialization through type inference (x := 0 instead of var x int = 0; or var x = 0;) Fast compilation Remote package management (go get) and online package documentation Distinctive approaches to particular problems: Built-in concurrency primitives: light-weight processes (goroutines), channels, and the select statement An interface system in place of virtual inheritance, and type embedding instead of non-virtual inheritance A toolchain that, by default, produces statically linked native binaries without external Go dependencies A desire to keep the language specification simple enough to hold in a programmer's head, in part by omitting features that are common in similar languages.\",\n",
      "  \"syntax\": \"Go's syntax includes changes from C aimed at keeping code concise and readable. A combined declaration/initialization operator was introduced that allows the programmer to write i := 3 or s := Hello, world!, without specifying the types of variables used. This contrasts with C's int i = 3; and const char *s = Hello, world!;. Go also removes the requirement to use parentheses in if statement conditions. Semicolons still terminate statements;[a] but are implicit when the end of a line occurs.[b] Methods may return multiple values, and returning a result, err pair is the conventional way a method indicates an error to its caller in Go.[c] Go adds literal syntaxes for initializing struct parameters by name and for initializing maps and slices. As an alternative to C's three-statement for loop, Go's range expressions allow concise iteration over arrays, slices, strings, maps, and channels.\",\n",
      "  \"types\": \"Go has a number of built-in types, including numeric ones (byte, int64, float32, etc.), Booleans, and byte strings (string). Strings are immutable; built-in operators and keywords (rather than functions) provide concatenation, comparison, and UTF-8 encoding/decoding. Record types can be defined with the struct keyword. For each type T and each non-negative integer constant n, there is an array type denoted [n]T; arrays of differing lengths are thus of different types. Dynamic arrays are available as slices, denoted []T for some type T. These have a length and a capacity specifying when new memory needs to be allocated to expand the array. Several slices may share their underlying memory. Pointers are available for all types, and the pointer-to-T type is denoted *T. Address-taking and indirection use the & and * operators, as in C, or happen implicitly through the method call or attribute access syntax. There is no pointer arithmetic,[d] except via the special unsafe.Pointer type in the standard library. For a pair of types K, V, the type map[K]V is the type mapping type-K keys to type-V values, though Go Programming Language specification does not give any performance guarantees or implementation requirements for map types. Hash tables are built into the language, with special syntax and built-in functions. chan T is a channel that allows sending values of type T between concurrent Go processes. Aside from its support for interfaces, Go's type system is nominal: the type keyword can be used to define a new named type, which is distinct from other named types that have the same layout (in the case of a struct, the same members in the same order). Some conversions between types (e.g., between the various integer types) are pre-defined and adding a new type may define additional conversions, but conversions between named types must always be invoked explicitly. For example, the type keyword can be used to define a type for IPv4 addresses, based on 32-bit unsigned integers as follows: type ipv4addr uint32 With this type definition, ipv4addr(x) interprets the uint32 value x as an IP address. Simply assigning x to a variable of type ipv4addr is a type error. Constant expressions may be either typed or untyped; they are given a type when assigned to a typed variable if the value they represent passes a compile-time check. Function types are indicated by the func keyword; they take zero or more parameters and return zero or more values, all of which are typed. The parameter and return values determine a function type; thus, func(string, int32) (int, error) is the type of functions that take a string and a 32-bit signed integer, and return a signed integer (of default width) and a value of the built-in interface type error. Any named type has a method set associated with it. The IP address example above can be extended with a method for checking whether its value is a known standard: // ZeroBroadcast reports whether addr is 255.255.255.255. func (addr ipv4addr) ZeroBroadcast() bool { return addr == 0xFFFFFFFF } Due to nominal typing, this method definition adds a method to ipv4addr, but not on uint32. While methods have special definition and call syntax, there is no distinct method type.\",\n",
      "  \"interface_system\": \"Go provides two features that replace class inheritance.[citation needed] The first is embedding, which can be viewed as an automated form of composition. The second are its interfaces, which provides runtime polymorphism.: 266 Interfaces are a class of types and provide a limited form of structural typing in the otherwise nominal type system of Go. An object which is of an interface type is also of another type, much like C++ objects being simultaneously of a base and derived class. The design of Go interfaces was inspired by protocols from the Smalltalk programming language. Multiple sources use the term duck typing when describing Go interfaces. Although the term duck typing is not precisely defined and therefore not wrong, it usually implies that type conformance is not statically checked. Because conformance to a Go interface is checked statically by the Go compiler (except when performing a type assertion), the Go authors prefer the term structural typing. The definition of an interface type lists required methods by name and type. Any object of type T for which functions exist matching all the required methods of interface type I is an object of type I as well. The definition of type T need not (and cannot) identify type I. For example, if Shape, Square and Circle are defined as import math type Shape interface { Area() float64 } type Square struct { // Note: no implements declaration side float64 } func (sq Square) Area() float64 { return sq.side * sq.side } type Circle struct { // No implements declaration here either radius float64 } func (c Circle) Area() float64 { return math.Pi * math.Pow(c.radius, 2) } then both a Square and a Circle are implicitly a Shape and can be assigned to a Shape-typed variable.: 263–268 In formal language, Go's interface system provides structural rather than nominal typing. Interfaces can embed other interfaces with the effect of creating a combined interface that is satisfied by exactly the types that implement the embedded interface and any methods that the newly defined interface adds.: 270 The Go standard library uses interfaces to provide genericity in several places, including the input/output system that is based on the concepts of Reader and Writer.: 282–283 Besides calling methods via interfaces, Go allows converting interface values to other types with a run-time type check. The language constructs to do so are the type assertion, which checks against a single potential type: var shp Shape = Square{5} square, ok := shp.(Square) // Asserts Square type on shp, should work if ok { fmt.Printf(%#v\\\\n, square) } else { fmt.Println(Can't print shape as Square) } and the type switch, which checks against multiple types:[citation needed] func (sq Square) Diagonal() float64 { return sq.side * math.Sqrt2 } func (c Circle) Diameter() float64 { return 2 * c.radius } func LongestContainedLine(shp Shape) float64 { switch v := shp.(type) { case Square: return v.Diagonal() // Or, with type assertion, shp.(Square).Diagonal() case Circle: return v.Diameter() // Or, with type assertion, shp.(Circle).Diameter() default: return 0 // In practice, this should be handled with errors } } The empty interface interface{} is an important base case because it can refer to an item of any concrete type. It is similar to the Object class in Java or C# and is satisfied by any type, including built-in types like int.: 284 Code using the empty interface cannot simply call methods (or built-in operators) on the referred-to object, but it can store the interface{} value, try to convert it to a more useful type via a type assertion or type switch, or inspect it with Go's reflect package. Because interface{} can refer to any value, it is a limited way to escape the restrictions of static typing, like void* in C but with additional run-time type checks.[citation needed] The interface{} type can be used to model structured data of any arbitrary schema in Go, such as JSON or YAML data, by representing it as a map[string]interface{} (map of string to empty interface). This recursively describes data in the form of a dictionary with string keys and values of any type. Interface values are implemented using pointer to data and a second pointer to run-time type information. Like some other types implemented using pointers in Go, interface values are nil if uninitialized.\",\n",
      "  \"generic_code_using_parameterized_types\": \"Since version 1.18, Go supports generic code using parameterized types. Functions and types now have the ability to be generic using type parameters. These type parameters are specified within square brackets, right after the function or type name. The compiler transforms the generic function or type into non-generic by substituting type arguments for the type parameters provided, either explicitly by the user or type inference by the compiler. This transformation process is referred to as type instantiation. Interfaces now can define a set of types (known as type set) using | (Union) operator, as well as a set of methods. These changes were made to support type constraints in generics code. For a generic function or type, a constraint can be thought of as the type of the type argument: a meta-type. This new ~T syntax will be the first use of ~ as a token in Go. ~T means the set of all types whose underlying type is T. type Number interface { ~int | ~float64 | ~float32 | ~int32 | ~int64 } func Add[T Number](nums ...T) T { var sum T for _, v := range nums { sum += v } return sum } func main() { add := Add[int] // Type instantiation println(add(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)) // 15 res := Add(1.1, 2.2, 3.3, 4.4, 5.5) // Type Inference println(res) // +1.650000e+001 }\",\n",

However the name used can be changed from the package name, and if imported as _, then no package prefix is required. Only the capitalized names from other packages are accessible: io.Reader is public but bzip2.reader is not. The go get command can retrieve packages stored in a remote repository and developers are encouraged to develop packages inside a base path corresponding to a source repository (such as example.com/user_name/package_name) to reduce the likelihood of name collision with future additions to the standard library or other external libraries.\",\n",
      "  \"concurrency_goroutines_and_channels\": \"DotGo 2015 - Matt Aimonetti - Applied concurrency in Go The Go language has built-in facilities, as well as library support, for writing concurrent programs. The runtime is asynchronous: program execution that performs for example a network read will be suspended until data is available to process, allowing other parts of the program to perform other work. This is built into the runtime and does not require any changes in program code. The go runtime also automatically schedules concurrent operations (goroutines) across multiple CPUs; this can achieve parallelism for a properly written program. The primary concurrency construct is the goroutine, a type of green thread.: 280–281 A function call prefixed with the go keyword starts a function in a new goroutine. The language specification does not specify how goroutines should be implemented, but current implementations multiplex a Go process's goroutines onto a smaller set of operating-system threads, similar to the scheduling performed in Erlang and Haskell's GHC runtime implementation.: 10 While a standard library package featuring most of the classical concurrency control structures (mutex locks, etc.) is available,: 151–152 idiomatic concurrent programs instead prefer channels, which send messages between goroutines. Optional buffers store messages in FIFO order: 43 and allow sending goroutines to proceed before their messages are received.: 233 Channels are typed, so that a channel of type chan T can only be used to transfer messages of type T. Special syntax is used to operate on them; <-ch is an expression that causes the executing goroutine to block until a value comes in over the channel ch, while ch <- x sends the value x (possibly blocking until another goroutine receives the value). The built-in switch-like select statement can be used to implement non-blocking communication on multiple channels; see below for an example. Go has a memory model describing how goroutines must use channels or other operations to safely share data. The existence of channels does not by itself set Go apart from actor model-style concurrent languages like Erlang, where messages are addressed directly to actors (corresponding to goroutines). In the actor model, channels are themselves actors, therefore addressing a channel just means to address an actor. The actor style can be simulated in Go by maintaining a one-to-one correspondence between goroutines and channels, but the language allows multiple goroutines to share a channel or a single goroutine to send and receive on multiple channels.: 147 From these tools one can build concurrent constructs like worker pools, pipelines (in which, say, a file is decompressed and parsed as it downloads), background calls with timeout, fan-out parallel calls to a set of services, and others. Channels have also found uses further from the usual notion of interprocess communication, like serving as a concurrency-safe list of recycled buffers, implementing coroutines (which helped inspire the name goroutine), and implementing iterators. Concurrency-related structural conventions of Go (channels and alternative channel inputs) are derived from Tony Hoare's communicating sequential processes model. Unlike previous concurrent programming languages such as Occam or Limbo (a language on which Go co-designer Rob Pike worked), Go does not provide any built-in notion of safe or verifiable concurrency. While the communicating-processes model is favored in Go, it is not the only one: all goroutines in a program share a single address space. This means that mutable objects and pointers can be shared between goroutines; see § Lack of data race safety, below.\",\n",
      "  \"suitability_for_parallel_programming\": \"Although Go's concurrency features are not aimed primarily at parallel processing, they can be used to program shared-memory multi-processor machines. Various studies have been done into the effectiveness of this approach. One of these studies compared the size (in lines of code) and speed of programs written by a seasoned programmer not familiar with the language and corrections to these programs by a Go expert (from Google's development team), doing the same for Chapel, Cilk and Intel TBB. The study found that the non-expert tended to write divide-and-conquer algorithms with one go statement per recursion, while the expert wrote distribute-work-synchronize programs using one goroutine per processor core. The expert's programs were usually faster, but also longer.\",\n",
      "  \"lack_of_data_race_safety\": \"Go's approach to concurrency can be summarized as don't communicate by sharing memory; share memory by communicating. There are no restrictions on how goroutines access shared data, making data races possible. Specifically, unless a program explicitly synchronizes via channels or other means, writes from one goroutine might be partly, entirely, or not at all visible to another, often with no guarantees about ordering of writes. Furthermore, Go's internal data structures like interface values, slice headers, hash tables, and string headers are not immune to data races, so type and memory safety can be violated in multithreaded programs that modify shared instances of those types without synchronization. Instead of language support, safe concurrent programming thus relies on conventions; for example, Chisnall recommends an idiom called aliases xor mutable, meaning that passing a mutable value (or pointer) over a channel signals a transfer of ownership over the value to its receiver.: 155 The gc toolchain has an optional data race detector that can check for unsynchronized access to shared memory during runtime since version 1.1, additionally a best-effort race detector is also included by default since version 1.6 of the gc runtime for access to the map data type.\",\n",
      "  \"binaries\": \"The linker in the gc toolchain creates statically linked binaries by default; therefore all Go binaries include the Go runtime.\",\n",
      "  \"omissions\": \"Go deliberately omits certain features common in other languages, including (implementation) inheritance, assertions,[e] pointer arithmetic,[d] implicit type conversions, untagged unions,[f] and tagged unions.[g] The designers added only those facilities that all three agreed on. Of the omitted language features, the designers explicitly argue against assertions and pointer arithmetic, while defending the choice to omit type inheritance as giving a more useful language, encouraging instead the use of interfaces to achieve dynamic dispatch[h] and composition to reuse code. Composition and delegation are in fact largely automated by struct embedding; according to researchers Schmager et al., this feature has many of the drawbacks of inheritance: it affects the public interface of objects, it is not fine-grained (i.e, no method-level control over embedding), methods of embedded objects cannot be hidden, and it is static, making it not obvious whether programmers will overuse it to the extent that programmers in other languages are reputed to overuse inheritance. Exception handling was initially omitted in Go due to lack of a design that gives value proportionate to the complexity. An exception-like panic/recover mechanism that avoids the usual try-catch control structure was proposed and released in the March 30, 2010 snapshot. The Go authors advise using it for unrecoverable errors such as those that should halt an entire program or server request, or as a shortcut to propagate errors up the stack within a package. Across package boundaries, Go includes a canonical error type, and multi-value returns using this type are the standard idiom.\",\n",
      "  \"style\": \"The Go authors put substantial effort into influencing the style of Go programs: Indentation, spacing, and other surface-level details of code are automatically standardized by the gofmt tool. It uses tabs for indentation and blanks for alignment. Alignment assumes that an editor is using a fixed-width font. golint does additional style checks automatically, but has been deprecated and archived by the Go maintainers. Tools and libraries distributed with Go suggest standard approaches to things like API documentation (godoc), testing (go test), building (go build), package management (go get), and so on. Go enforces rules that are recommendations in other languages, for example banning cyclic dependencies, unused variables or imports, and implicit type conversions. The omission of certain features (for example, functional-programming shortcuts like map and Java-style try/finally blocks) tends to encourage a particular explicit, concrete, and imperative programming style. On day one the Go team published a collection of Go idioms, and later also collected code review comments, talks, and official blog posts to teach Go style and coding philosophy.\",\n",
      "  \"tools\": \"The main Go distribution includes tools for building, testing, and analyzing code: go build, which builds Go binaries using only information in the source files themselves, no separate makefiles go test, for unit testing and microbenchmarks as well as fuzzing go fmt, for formatting code go install, for retrieving and installing remote packages go vet, a static analyzer looking for potential errors in code go run, a shortcut for building and executing code go doc, for displaying documentation go generate, a standard way to invoke code generators go mod, for creating a new module, adding dependencies, upgrading dependencies, etc. go tool, for invoking developer tools (added in Go version 1.24) It also includes profiling and debugging support, fuzzing capabilities to detect bugs, runtime instrumentation (for example, to track garbage collection pauses), and a data race detector. Another tool maintained by the Go team but is not included in Go distributions is gopls, a language server that provides IDE features such as intelligent code completion to Language Server Protocol compatible editors. An ecosystem of third-party tools adds to the standard distribution, such as gocode, which enables code autocompletion in many text editors, goimports, which automatically adds/removes package imports as needed, and errcheck, which detects code that might unintentionally ignore errors.\",\n",

      "  \"reception\": \"The interface system, and the deliberate omission of inheritance, were praised by Michele Simionato, who likened these characteristics to those of Standard ML, calling it a shame that no popular language has followed [this] particular route. Dave Astels at Engine Yard wrote in 2009: Go is extremely easy to dive into. There are a minimal number of fundamental language concepts and the syntax is clean and designed to be clear and unambiguous. Go is still experimental and still a little rough around the edges. Go was named Programming Language of the Year by the TIOBE Programming Community Index in its first year, 2009, for having a larger 12-month increase in popularity (in only 2 months, after its introduction in November) than any other language that year, and reached 13th place by January 2010, surpassing established languages like Pascal. By June 2015, its ranking had dropped to below 50th in the index, placing it lower than COBOL and Fortran. But as of January 2017, its ranking had surged to 13th, indicating significant growth in popularity and adoption. Go was again awarded TIOBE Programming Language of the Year in 2016. Bruce Eckel has stated: The complexity of C++ (even more complexity has been added in the new C++), and the resulting impact on productivity, is no longer justified. All the hoops that the C++ programmer had to jump through in order to use a C-compatible language make no sense anymore -- they're just a waste of time and effort. Go makes much more sense for the class of problems that C++ was originally intended to solve. A 2011 evaluation of the language and its gc implementation in comparison to C++ (GCC), Java and Scala by a Google engineer found: Go offers interesting language features, which also allow for a concise and standardized notation. The compilers for this language are still immature, which reflects in both performance and binary sizes.— R. Hundt The evaluation got a rebuttal from the Go development team. Ian Lance Taylor, who had improved the Go code for Hundt's paper, had not been aware of the intention to publish his code, and says that his version was never intended to be an example of idiomatic or efficient Go; Russ Cox then optimized the Go code, as well as the C++ code, and got the Go code to run almost as fast as the C++ version and more than an order of magnitude faster than the code in the paper. Go's nil combined with the lack of algebraic types leads to difficulty handling failures and base cases. Go does not allow an opening brace to appear on its own line, which forces all Go programmers to use the same brace style. Go has been criticized for focusing on simplicity of implementation rather than correctness and flexibility; as an example, the language uses POSIX file semantics on all platforms, and therefore provides incorrect information on platforms such as Windows (which do not follow the aforementioned standard). A study showed that it is as easy to make concurrency bugs with message passing as with shared memory, sometimes even more.\",\n",
      "  \"naming_dispute\": \"On November 10, 2009, the day of the general release of the language, Francis McCabe, developer of the Go! programming language (note the exclamation point), requested a name change of Google's language to prevent confusion with his language, which he had spent 10 years developing. McCabe raised concerns that the 'big guy' will end up steam-rollering over him, and this concern resonated with the more than 120 developers who commented on Google's official issues thread saying they should change the name, with some even saying the issue contradicts Google's motto of: Don't be evil. On October 12, 2010, the filed public issue ticket was closed by Google developer Russ Cox (@rsc) with the custom status Unfortunate accompanied by the following comment: There are many computing products and services named Go. In the 11 months since our release, there has been minimal confusion of the two languages.\",\n",

      "  \"overview\": \"Dennis Ritchie (right), the inventor of the C programming language, with Ken Thompson C is an imperative, procedural language in the ALGOL tradition. It has a static type system. In C, all executable code is contained within subroutines (also called functions, though not in the sense of functional programming). Function parameters are passed by value, although arrays are passed as pointers, i.e. the address of the first item in the array. Pass-by-reference is simulated in C by explicitly passing pointers to the thing being referenced. C program source text is free-form code. Semicolons terminate statements, while curly braces are used to group statements into blocks. The C language also exhibits the following characteristics: The language has a small, fixed number of keywords, including a full set of control flow primitives: if/else, for, do/while, while, and switch. User-defined names are not distinguished from keywords by any kind of sigil. It has a large number of arithmetic, bitwise, and logic operators: +,+=,++,&,||, etc. More than one assignment may be performed in a single statement. Functions: Function return values can be ignored, when not needed. Function and data pointers permit ad hoc run-time polymorphism. Functions may not be defined within the lexical scope of other functions. Variables may be defined within a function, with scope. A function may call itself, so recursion is supported. Data typing is static, but weakly enforced; all data has a type, but implicit conversions are possible. User-defined (typedef) and compound types are possible. Heterogeneous aggregate data types (struct) allow related data elements to be accessed and assigned as a unit. The contents of whole structs cannot be compared using a single built-in operator (the elements must be compared individually). Union is a structure with overlapping members; it allows multiple data types to share the same memory location. Array indexing is a secondary notation, defined in terms of pointer arithmetic. Whole arrays cannot be assigned or compared using a single built-in operator. There is no array keyword in use or definition; instead, square brackets indicate arrays syntactically, for example month. Enumerated types are possible with the enum keyword. They are freely interconvertible with integers. Strings are not a distinct data type, but are conventionally implemented as null-terminated character arrays. Low-level access to computer memory is possible by converting machine addresses to pointers. Procedures (subroutines not returning values) are a special case of function, with an empty return type void. Memory can be allocated to a program with calls to library routines. A preprocessor performs macro definition, source code file inclusion, and conditional compilation. There is a basic form of modularity: files can be compiled separately and linked together, with control over which functions and data objects are visible to other files via static and extern attributes. Complex functionality such as I/O, string manipulation, and mathematical functions are consistently delegated to library routines. The generated code after compilation has relatively straightforward needs on the underlying platform, which makes it suitable for creating operating systems and for use in embedded systems. While C does not include certain features found in other languages (such as object orientation and garbage collection), these can be implemented or emulated, often through the use of external libraries (e.g., the GLib Object System or the Boehm garbage collector).\",\n",
      "  \"relations_to_other_languages\": \"Main article: List of C-family programming languages Many later languages have borrowed directly or indirectly from C, including C++, C#, Unix's C shell, D, Go, Java, JavaScript (including transpilers), Julia, Limbo, LPC, Objective-C, Perl, PHP, Python, Ruby, Rust, Swift, Verilog and SystemVerilog (hardware description languages). These languages have drawn many of their control structures and other basic features from C. Most of them also express highly similar syntax to C, and they tend to combine the recognizable expression and statement syntax of C with underlying type systems, data models, and semantics that can be radically different.\",\n",
      "  \"early_developments\": \"Timeline of C language Year Informalname Officialstandard 1972 first release — 1978 K&R C — 1989,1990 ANSI C, C89,ISO C, C90 ANSI X3.159-1989ISO/IEC 9899:1990 1999 C99, C9X ISO/IEC 9899:1999 2011 C11, C1X ISO/IEC 9899:2011 2018 C17, C18 ISO/IEC 9899:2018 2024 C23, C2X ISO/IEC 9899:2024 TBA C2Y The origin of C is closely tied to the development of the Unix operating system, originally implemented in assembly language on a PDP-7 by Dennis Ritchie and Ken Thompson, incorporating several ideas from colleagues. Eventually, they decided to port the operating system to a PDP-11. The original PDP-11 version of Unix was also developed in assembly language.\",\n",
      "  \"b\": \"Main article: B (programming language) Thompson wanted a programming language for developing utilities for the new platform. He first tried writing a Fortran compiler, but he soon gave up the idea and instead created a cut-down version of the recently developed systems programming language called BCPL. The official description of BCPL was not available at the time, and Thompson modified the syntax to be less 'wordy' and similar to a simplified ALGOL known as SMALGOL. He called the result B, describing it as BCPL semantics with a lot of SMALGOL syntax. Like BCPL, B had a bootstrapping compiler to facilitate porting to new machines. Ultimately, few utilities were written in B because it was too slow and could not take advantage of PDP-11 features such as byte addressability.\",\n",
      "  \"new_b_and_first_c_release\": \"In 1971 Ritchie started to improve B, to use the features of the more-powerful PDP-11. A significant addition was a character data type. He called this New B (NB). Thompson started to use NB to write the Unix kernel, and his requirements shaped the direction of the language development. Through to 1972, richer types were added to the NB language: NB had arrays of int and char. Pointers, the ability to generate pointers to other types, arrays of all types, and types to be returned from functions were all also added. Arrays within expressions became pointers. A new compiler was written, and the language was renamed C. The C compiler and some utilities made with it were included in Version 2 Unix, which is also known as Research Unix.\",\n",
      "  \"structures_and_unix_kernel_re_write\": \"At Version 4 Unix, released in November 1973, the Unix kernel was extensively re-implemented in C. By this time, the C language had acquired some powerful features such as struct types. The preprocessor was introduced around 1973 at the urging of Alan Snyder and also in recognition of the usefulness of the file-inclusion mechanisms available in BCPL and PL/I. Its original version provided only included files and simple string replacements: #include and #define of parameterless macros. Soon after that, it was extended, mostly by Mike Lesk and then by John Reiser, to incorporate macros with arguments and conditional compilation. Unix was one of the first operating system kernels implemented in a language other than assembly. Earlier instances include the Multics system (which was written in PL/I) and Master Control Program (MCP) for the Burroughs B5000 (which was written in ALGOL) in 1961. In around 1977, Ritchie and Stephen C. Johnson made further changes to the language to facilitate portability of the Unix operating system. Johnson's Portable C Compiler served as the basis for several implementations of C on new platforms.\",\n",
      "  \"kr_c\": \"The cover of the book The C Programming Language, first edition, by Brian Kernighan and Dennis Ritchie In 1978 Brian Kernighan and Dennis Ritchie published the first edition of The C Programming Language. Known as K&R from the initials of its authors, the book served for many years as an informal specification of the language. The version of C that it describes is commonly referred to as K&R C. As this was released in 1978, it is now also referred to as C78. The second edition of the book covers the later ANSI C standard, described below. K&R introduced several language features: Standard I/O library long int data type unsigned int data type Compound assignment operators of the form =op (such as =-) were changed to the form op= (that is, -=) to remove the semantic ambiguity created by constructs such as i=-10, which had been interpreted as i =- 10 (decrement i by 10) instead of the possibly intended i = -10 (let i be −10). Even after the publication of the 1989 ANSI standard, for many years K&R C was still considered the lowest common denominator to which C programmers restricted themselves when maximum portability was desired, since many older compilers were still in use, and because carefully written K&R C code can be legal Standard C as well. In early versions of C, only functions that return types other than int must be declared if used before the function definition; functions used without prior declaration were presumed to return type int. For example: long some_function(); /* This is a function declaration, so the compiler can know the name and return type of this function. */ /* int */ other_function(); /* Another function declaration. Because this is an early version of C, there is an implicit 'int' type here. A comment shows where the explicit 'int' type specifier would be required in later versions. */ /* int */ calling_function() /* This is a function definition, including the body of the code following in the { curly brackets }. Because no return type is specified, the function implicitly returns an 'int' in this early version of C. */ { long test1; register /* int */ test2; /* Again, note that 'int' is not required here. The 'int' type specifier */ /* in the comment would be required in later versions of C. */ /* The 'register' keyword indicates to the compiler that this variable should */ /* ideally be stored in a register as opposed to within the stack frame. */ test1 = some_function(); if (test1 > 1) test2 = 0; else test2 = other_function(); return test2; } The int type specifiers which are commented out could be omitted in K&R C, but are required in later standards. Since K&R function declarations did not include any information about function arguments, function parameter type checks were not performed, although some compilers would issue a warning message if a local function was called with the wrong number of arguments, or if different calls to an external function used different numbers or types of arguments. Separate tools such as Unix's lint utility were developed that (among other things) could check for consistency of function use across multiple source files. In the years following the publication of K&R C, several features were added to the language, supported by compilers from AT&T (in particular PCC) and some other vendors. These included: void functions (i.e., functions with no return value) functions returning struct or union types (previously only a single pointer, integer or float could be returned) assignment for struct data types enumerated types (previously, preprocessor definitions for integer fixed values were used, e.g. #define GREEN 3) The large number of extensions and lack of agreement on a standard library, together with the language popularity and the fact that not even the Unix compilers precisely implemented the K&R specification, led to the necessity of standardization.\",\n",
      "  \"ansi_c_and_iso_c\": \"Main article: ANSI C During the late 1970s and 1980s, versions of C were implemented for a wide variety of mainframe computers, minicomputers, and microcomputers, including the IBM PC, as its popularity began to increase significantly. In 1983 the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) formed a committee, X3J11, to establish a standard specification of C. X3J11 based the C standard on the Unix implementation; however, the non-portable portion of the Unix C library was handed off to the IEEE working group 1003 to become the basis for the 1988 POSIX standard. In 1989, the C standard was ratified as ANSI X3.159-1989 Programming Language C. This version of the language is often referred to as ANSI C, Standard C, or sometimes C89. In 1990 the ANSI C standard (with formatting changes) was adopted by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) as ISO/IEC 9899:1990, which is sometimes called C90. Therefore, the terms C89 and C90 refer to the same programming language. ANSI, like other national standards bodies, no longer develops the C standard independently, but defers to the international C standard, maintained by the working group ISO/IEC JTC1/SC22/WG14. National adoption of an update to the international standard typically occurs within a year of ISO publication. One of the aims of the C standardization process was to produce a superset of K&R C, incorporating many of the subsequently introduced unofficial features. The standards committee also included several additional features such as function prototypes (borrowed from C++), void pointers, support for international character sets and locales, and preprocessor enhancements. Although the syntax for parameter declarations was augmented to include the style used in C++, the K&R interface continued to be permitted, for compatibility with existing source code. C89 is supported by current C compilers, and most modern C code is based on it. Any program written only in Standard C and without any hardware-dependent assumptions will run correctly on any platform with a conforming C implementation, within its resource limits. Without such precautions, programs may compile only on a certain platform or with a particular compiler, due, for example, to the use of non-standard libraries, such as GUI libraries, or to a reliance on compiler- or platform-specific attributes such as the exact size of data types and byte endianness. In cases where code must be compilable by either standard-conforming or K&R C-based compilers, the __STDC__ macro can be used to split the code into Standard and K&R sections to prevent the use on a K&R C-based compiler of features available only in Standard C. After the ANSI/ISO standardization process, the C language specification remained relatively static for several years. In 1995, Normative Amendment 1 to the 1990 C standard (ISO/IEC 9899/AMD1:1995, known informally as C95) was published, to correct some details and to add more extensive support for international character sets.\",\n",
      "  \"c\": \"Main article: C23 (C standard revision) C23 is an informal name for the current major C language standard revision. It was informally known as C2X through most of its development. C23 was published in October 2024 as ISO/IEC 9899:2024. The standard macro __STDC_VERSION__ is defined as 202311L to indicate that C23 support is available.\",\n",

      "  \"embedded_c\": \"Main article: Embedded C Historically, embedded C programming requires non-standard extensions to the C language to support exotic features such as fixed-point arithmetic, multiple distinct memory banks, and basic I/O operations. In 2008, the C Standards Committee published a technical report extending the C language to address these issues by providing a common standard for all implementations to adhere to. It includes a number of features not available in normal C, such as fixed-point arithmetic, named address spaces, and basic I/O hardware addressing.\",\n",
      "  \"syntax\": \"Main article: C syntax C has a formal grammar specified by the C standard. Line endings are generally not significant in C; however, line boundaries do have significance during the preprocessing phase. Comments may appear either between the delimiters /* and */, or (since C99) following // until the end of the line. Comments delimited by /* and */ do not nest, and these sequences of characters are not interpreted as comment delimiters if they appear inside string or character literals. C source files contain declarations and function definitions. Function definitions, in turn, contain declarations and statements. Declarations either define new types using keywords such as struct, union, and enum, or assign types to and perhaps reserve storage for new variables, usually by writing the type followed by the variable name. Keywords such as char and int specify built-in types. Sections of code are enclosed in braces ({ and }, sometimes called curly brackets) to limit the scope of declarations and to act as a single statement for control structures. As an imperative language, C uses statements to specify actions. The most common statement is an expression statement, consisting of an expression to be evaluated, followed by a semicolon; as a side effect of the evaluation, functions may be called and variables assigned new values. To modify the normal sequential execution of statements, C provides several control-flow statements identified by reserved keywords. Structured programming is supported by if ... [else] conditional execution and by do ... while, while, and for iterative execution (looping). The for statement has separate initialization, testing, and reinitialization expressions, any or all of which can be omitted. break and continue can be used within the loop. Break is used to leave the innermost enclosing loop statement and continue is used to skip to its reinitialisation. There is also a non-structured goto statement which branches directly to the designated label within the function. switch selects a case to be executed based on the value of an integer expression. Different from many other languages, control-flow will fall through to the next case unless terminated by a break. Expressions can use a variety of built-in operators and may contain function calls. The order in which arguments to functions and operands to most operators are evaluated is unspecified. The evaluations may even be interleaved. However, all side effects (including storage to variables) will occur before the next sequence point; sequence points include the end of each expression statement, and the entry to and return from each function call. Sequence points also occur during evaluation of expressions containing certain operators (&&, ||, ?: and the comma operator). This permits a high degree of object code optimization by the compiler, but requires C programmers to take more care to obtain reliable results than is needed for other programming languages. Kernighan and Ritchie say in the Introduction of The C Programming Language: C, like any other language, has its blemishes. Some of the operators have the wrong precedence; some parts of the syntax could be better. The C standard did not attempt to correct many of these blemishes, because of the impact of such changes on already existing software.\",\n",
      "  \"character_set\": \"The basic C source character set includes the following characters: Lowercase and uppercase letters of the ISO basic Latin alphabet: a–z, A–Z Decimal digits: 0–9 Graphic characters: !  # % & ' ( ) * + , - . / : ; < = > ? [ \\\\ ] ^ _ { | } ~ Whitespace characters: space, horizontal tab, vertical tab, form feed, newline The newline character indicates the end of a text line; it need not correspond to an actual single character, although for convenience C treats it as such. Additional multi-byte encoded characters may be used in string literals, but they are not entirely portable. Since C99 multi-national Unicode characters can be embedded portably within C source text by using \\\\uXXXX or \\\\UXXXXXXXX encoding (where X denotes a hexadecimal character). The basic C execution character set contains the same characters, along with representations for alert, backspace, and carriage return. Run-time support for extended character sets has increased with each revision of the C standard.\",\n",
      "  \"reserved_words\": \"The following reserved words are case sensitive. C89 has 32 reserved words, also known as 'keywords', which cannot be used for any purposes other than those for which they are predefined: auto break case char const continue default do double else enum extern float for goto if int long register return short signed sizeof static struct switch typedef union unsigned void volatile while C99 added five more reserved words: (‡ indicates an alternative spelling alias for a C23 keyword) inline restrict _Bool ‡ _Complex _Imaginary C11 added seven more reserved words: (‡ indicates an alternative spelling alias for a C23 keyword) _Alignas ‡ _Alignof ‡ _Atomic _Generic _Noreturn _Static_assert ‡ _Thread_local ‡ C23 reserved fifteen more words: alignas alignof bool constexpr false nullptr static_assert thread_local true typeof typeof_unqual _BitInt _Decimal32 _Decimal64 _Decimal128 Most of the recently reserved words begin with an underscore followed by a capital letter, because identifiers of that form were previously reserved by the C standard for use only by implementations. Since existing program source code should not have been using these identifiers, it would not be affected when C implementations started supporting these extensions to the programming language. Some standard headers do define more convenient synonyms for underscored identifiers. Some of those words were added as keywords with their conventional spelling in C23 and the corresponding macros were removed. Prior to C89, entry was reserved as a keyword. In the second edition of their book The C Programming Language, which describes what became known as C89, Kernighan and Ritchie wrote, The ... [keyword] entry, formerly reserved but never used, is no longer reserved. and The stillborn entry keyword is withdrawn.\",\n",
      "  \"operators\": \"Main article: Operators in C and C++ C supports a rich set of operators, which are symbols used within an expression to specify the manipulations to be performed while evaluating that expression. C has operators for: arithmetic: +, -, *, /, % assignment: = augmented assignment: +=, -=, *=, /=, %=, &=, |=, ^=, <<=, >>= bitwise logic: ~, &, |, ^ bitwise shifts: <<, >> Boolean logic: !, &&, || conditional evaluation: ? : equality testing: ==, != calling functions: ( ) increment and decrement: ++, -- member selection: ., -> object size: sizeof type: typeof, typeof_unqual since C23 order relations: <, <=, >, >= reference and dereference: &, *, [ ] sequencing: , subexpression grouping: ( ) type conversion: (typename) C uses the operator = (used in mathematics to express equality) to indicate assignment, following the precedent of Fortran and PL/I, but unlike ALGOL and its derivatives. C uses the operator == to test for equality. The similarity between the operators for assignment and equality may result in the accidental use of one in place of the other, and in many cases the mistake does not produce an error message (although some compilers produce warnings). For example, the conditional expression if (a == b + 1) might mistakenly be written as if (a = b + 1), which will be evaluated as true unless the value of a is 0 after the assignment. The C operator precedence is not always intuitive. For example, the operator == binds more tightly than (is executed prior to) the operators & (bitwise AND) and | (bitwise OR) in expressions such as x & 1 == 0, which must be written as (x & 1) == 0 if that is the coder's intent.\",\n",
      "  \"data_types\": \"Main article: C data types This section needs additional citations for verification. Please help improve this article by adding citations to reliable sources in this section. Unsourced material may be challenged and removed. (October 2012) (Learn how and when to remove this message) The type system in C is static and weakly typed, which makes it similar to the type system of ALGOL descendants such as Pascal. There are built-in types for integers of various sizes, both signed and unsigned, floating-point numbers, and enumerated types (enum). Integer type char is often used for single-byte characters. C99 added a Boolean data type. There are also derived types including arrays, pointers, records (struct), and unions (union). C is often used in low-level systems programming where escapes from the type system may be necessary. The compiler attempts to ensure type correctness of most expressions, but the programmer can override the checks in various ways, either by using a type cast to explicitly convert a value from one type to another, or by using pointers or unions to reinterpret the underlying bits of a data object in some other way. Some find C's declaration syntax unintuitive, particularly for function pointers. (Ritchie's idea was to declare identifiers in contexts resembling their use: declaration reflects use.) C's usual arithmetic conversions allow for efficient code to be generated, but can sometimes produce unexpected results. For example, a comparison of signed and unsigned integers of equal width requires a conversion of the signed value to unsigned. This can generate unexpected results if the signed value is negative.\",\n",
      "  \"pointers\": \"C supports the use of pointers, a type of reference that records the address or location of an object or function in memory. Pointers can be dereferenced to access data stored at the address pointed to, or to invoke a pointed-to function. Pointers can be manipulated using assignment or pointer arithmetic. The run-time representation of a pointer value is typically a raw memory address (perhaps augmented by an offset-within-word field), but since a pointer's type includes the type of the thing pointed to, expressions including pointers can be type-checked at compile time. Pointer arithmetic is automatically scaled by the size of the pointed-to data type. Pointers are used for many purposes in C. Text strings are commonly manipulated using pointers into arrays of characters. Dynamic memory allocation is performed using pointers; the result of a malloc is usually cast to the data type of the data to be stored. Many data types, such as trees, are commonly implemented as dynamically allocated struct objects linked together using pointers. Pointers to other pointers are often used in multi-dimensional arrays and arrays of struct objects. Pointers to functions (function pointers) are useful for passing functions as arguments to higher-order functions (such as qsort or bsearch), in dispatch tables, or as callbacks to event handlers. A null pointer value explicitly points to no valid location. Dereferencing a null pointer value is undefined, often resulting in a segmentation fault. Null pointer values are useful for indicating special cases such as no next pointer in the final node of a linked list, or as an error indication from functions returning pointers. In appropriate contexts in source code, such as for assigning to a pointer variable, a null pointer constant can be written as 0, with or without explicit casting to a pointer type, as the NULL macro defined by several standard headers or, since C23 with the constant nullptr. In conditional contexts, null pointer values evaluate to false, while all other pointer values evaluate to true. Void pointers (void *) point to objects of unspecified type, and can therefore be used as generic data pointers. Since the size and type of the pointed-to object is not known, void pointers cannot be dereferenced, nor is pointer arithmetic on them allowed, although they can easily be (and in many contexts implicitly are) converted to and from any other object pointer type. Careless use of pointers is potentially dangerous. Because they are typically unchecked, a pointer variable can be made to point to any arbitrary location, which can cause undesirable effects. Although properly used pointers point to safe places, they can be made to point to unsafe places by using invalid pointer arithmetic; the objects they point to may continue to be used after deallocation (dangling pointers); they may be used without having been initialized (wild pointers); or they may be directly assigned an unsafe value using a cast, union, or through another corrupt pointer. In general, C is permissive in allowing manipulation of and conversion between pointer types, although compilers typically provide options for various levels of checking. Some other programming languages address these problems by using more restrictive reference types.\",\n",
      "  \"arrays\": \"See also: C string handling Array types in C are traditionally of a fixed, static size specified at compile time. The more recent C99 standard also allows a form of variable-length arrays. However, it is also possible to allocate a block of memory (of arbitrary size) at run-time, using the standard library's malloc function, and treat it as an array. Since arrays are always accessed (in effect) via pointers, array accesses are typically not checked against the underlying array size, although some compilers may provide bounds checking as an option. Array bounds violations are therefore possible and can lead to various repercussions, including illegal memory accesses, corruption of data, buffer overruns, and run-time exceptions. C does not have a special provision for declaring multi-dimensional arrays, but rather relies on recursion within the type system to declare arrays of arrays, which effectively accomplishes the same thing. The index values of the resulting multi-dimensional array can be thought of as increasing in row-major order. Multi-dimensional arrays are commonly used in numerical algorithms (mainly from applied linear algebra) to store matrices. The structure of the C array is well suited to this particular task. However, in early versions of C the bounds of the array must be known fixed values or else explicitly passed to any subroutine that requires them, and dynamically sized arrays of arrays cannot be accessed using double indexing. (A workaround for this was to allocate the array with an additional row vector of pointers to the columns.) C99 introduced variable-length arrays which address this issue. The following example using modern C (C99 or later) shows allocation of a two-dimensional array on the heap and the use of multi-dimensional array indexing for accesses (which can use bounds-checking on many C compilers): int func(int N, int M) { float (*p)[N] [M] = malloc(sizeof *p); if (p == 0) return -1; for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) for (int j = 0; j < M; j++) (*p)[i] [j] = i + j; print_array(N, M, p); free(p); return 1; } And here is a similar implementation using C99's Auto VLA feature:[d] int func(int N, int M) { // Caution: checks should be made to ensure N*M*sizeof(float) does NOT exceed limitations for auto VLAs and is within available size of stack. float p[N] [M]; // auto VLA is held on the stack, and sized when the function is invoked for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) for (int j = 0; j < M; j++) p[i] [j] = i + j; print_array(N, M, p); // no need to free(p) since it will disappear when the function exits, along with the rest of the stack frame return 1; }\",\n",
      "  \"arraypointer_interchangeability\": \"The subscript notation x[i] (where x designates a pointer) is syntactic sugar for *(x+i). Taking advantage of the compiler's knowledge of the pointer type, the address that x + i points to is not the base address (pointed to by x) incremented by i bytes, but rather is defined to be the base address incremented by i multiplied by the size of an element that x points to. Thus, x[i] designates the i+1th element of the array. Furthermore, in most expression contexts (a notable exception is as operand of sizeof), an expression of array type is automatically converted to a pointer to the array's first element. This implies that an array is never copied as a whole when named as an argument to a function, but rather only the address of its first element is passed. Therefore, although function calls in C use pass-by-value semantics, arrays are in effect passed by reference. The total size of an array x can be determined by applying sizeof to an expression of array type. The size of an element can be determined by applying the operator sizeof to any dereferenced element of an array A, as in n = sizeof A. Thus, the number of elements in a declared array A can be determined as sizeof A / sizeof A. Note, that if only a pointer to the first element is available as it is often the case in C code because of the automatic conversion described above, the information about the full type of the array and its length are lost.\",\n",
      "  \"memory_management\": \"One of the most important functions of a programming language is to provide facilities for managing memory and the objects that are stored in memory. C provides three principal ways to allocate memory for objects: Static memory allocation: space for the object is provided in the binary at compile-time; these objects have an extent (or lifetime) as long as the binary which contains them is loaded into memory. Automatic memory allocation: temporary objects can be stored on the stack, and this space is automatically freed and reusable after the block in which they are declared is exited. Dynamic memory allocation: blocks of memory of arbitrary size can be requested at run-time using library functions such as malloc from a region of memory called the heap; these blocks persist until subsequently freed for reuse by calling the library function realloc or free. These three approaches are appropriate in different situations and have various trade-offs. For example, static memory allocation has little allocation overhead, automatic allocation may involve slightly more overhead, and dynamic memory allocation can potentially have a great deal of overhead for both allocation and deallocation. The persistent nature of static objects is useful for maintaining state information across function calls, automatic allocation is easy to use but stack space is typically much more limited and transient than either static memory or heap space, and dynamic memory allocation allows convenient allocation of objects whose size is known only at run-time. Most C programs make extensive use of all three. Where possible, automatic or static allocation is usually simplest because the storage is managed by the compiler, freeing the programmer of the potentially error-prone chore of manually allocating and releasing storage. However, many data structures can change in size at runtime, and since static allocations (and automatic allocations before C99) must have a fixed size at compile-time, there are many situations in which dynamic allocation is necessary. Prior to the C99 standard, variable-sized arrays were a common example of this. (See the article on C dynamic memory allocation for an example of dynamically allocated arrays.) Unlike automatic allocation, which can fail at run time with uncontrolled consequences, the dynamic allocation functions return an indication (in the form of a null pointer value) when the required storage cannot be allocated. (Static allocation that is too large is usually detected by the linker or loader, before the program can even begin execution.) Unless otherwise specified, static objects contain zero or null pointer values upon program startup. Automatically and dynamically allocated objects are initialized only if an initial value is explicitly specified; otherwise they initially have indeterminate values (typically, whatever bit pattern happens to be present in the storage, which might not even represent a valid value for that type). If the program attempts to access an uninitialized value, the results are undefined. Many modern compilers try to detect and warn about this problem, but both false positives and false negatives can occur. Heap memory allocation has to be synchronized with its actual usage in any program to be reused as much as possible. For example, if the only pointer to a heap memory allocation goes out of scope or has its value overwritten before it is deallocated explicitly, then that memory cannot be recovered for later reuse and is essentially lost to the program, a phenomenon known as a memory leak. Conversely, it is possible for memory to be freed, but is referenced subsequently, leading to unpredictable results. Typically, the failure symptoms appear in a portion of the program unrelated to the code that causes the error, making it difficult to diagnose the failure. Such issues are ameliorated in languages with automatic garbage collection.\",\n",
      "  \"libraries\": \"The C programming language uses libraries as its primary method of extension. In C, a library is a set of functions contained within a single archive file. Each library typically has a header file, which contains the prototypes of the functions contained within the library that may be used by a program, and declarations of special data types and macro symbols used with these functions. For a program to use a library, it must include the library's header file, and the library must be linked with the program, which in many cases requires compiler flags (e.g., -lm, shorthand for link the math library). The most common C library is the C standard library, which is specified by the ISO and ANSI C standards and comes with every C implementation (implementations which target limited environments such as embedded systems may provide only a subset of the standard library). This library supports stream input and output, memory allocation, mathematics, character strings, and time values. Several separate standard headers (for example, stdio.h) specify the interfaces for these and other standard library facilities. Another common set of C library functions are those used by applications specifically targeted for Unix and Unix-like systems, especially functions which provide an interface to the kernel. These functions are detailed in various standards such as POSIX and the Single UNIX Specification. Since many programs have been written in C, there are a wide variety of other libraries available. Libraries are often written in C because C compilers generate efficient object code; programmers then create interfaces to the library so that the routines can be used from higher-level languages like Java, Perl, and Python.\",\n",
      "  \"file_handling_and_streams\": \"File input and output (I/O) is not part of the C language itself but instead is handled by libraries (such as the C standard library) and their associated header files (e.g. stdio.h). File handling is generally implemented through high-level I/O which works through streams. A stream is from this perspective a data flow that is independent of devices, while a file is a concrete device. The high-level I/O is done through the association of a stream to a file. In the C standard library, a buffer (a memory area or queue) is temporarily used to store data before it is sent to the final destination. This reduces the time spent waiting for slower devices, for example a hard drive or solid-state drive. Low-level I/O functions are not part of the standard C library[clarification needed] but are generally part of bare metal programming (programming that is independent of any operating system such as most embedded programming). With few exceptions, implementations include low-level I/O.\",\n",

Unsourced material may be challenged and removed. (July 2014) (Learn how and when to remove this message) A number of tools have been developed to help C programmers find and fix statements with undefined behavior or possibly erroneous expressions, with greater rigor than that provided by the compiler. Automated source code checking and auditing tools exist, such as Lint. A common practice is to use Lint to detect questionable code when a program is first written. Once a program passes Lint, it is then compiled using the C compiler. Also, many compilers can optionally warn about syntactically valid constructs that are likely to actually be errors. MISRA C is a proprietary set of guidelines to avoid such questionable code, developed for embedded systems. There are also compilers, libraries, and operating system level mechanisms for performing actions that are not a standard part of C, such as bounds checking for arrays, detection of buffer overflow, serialization, dynamic memory tracking, and automatic garbage collection. Memory management checking tools like Purify or Valgrind and linking with libraries containing special versions of the memory allocation functions can help uncover runtime errors in memory usage.\",\n",
      "  \"rationale_for_use_in_systems_programming\": \"Some software written in C C is widely used for systems programming in implementing operating systems and embedded system applications. This is for several reasons: The C language permits platform hardware and memory to be accessed with pointers and type punning, so system-specific features (e.g. Control/Status Registers, I/O registers) can be configured and used with code written in C – it allows fullest control of the platform it is running on. The code generated after compilation does not demand many system features, and can be invoked from some boot code in a straightforward manner – it is simple to execute. The C language statements and expressions typically map well on to sequences of instructions for the target processor, and consequently there is a low run-time demand on system resources – it is fast to execute. With its rich set of operators, the C language can use many of the features of target CPUs. Where a particular CPU has more esoteric instructions, a language variant can be constructed with perhaps intrinsic functions to exploit those instructions – it can use practically all the target CPU's features. The language makes it easy to overlay structures onto blocks of binary data, allowing the data to be comprehended, navigated and modified – it can write data structures, even file systems. The language supports a rich set of operators, including bit manipulation, for integer arithmetic and logic, and perhaps different sizes of floating point numbers – it can process appropriately-structured data effectively. C is a fairly small language, with only a handful of statements, and without too many features that generate extensive target code – it is comprehensible. C has direct control over memory allocation and deallocation, which gives reasonable efficiency and predictable timing to memory-handling operations, without any concerns for sporadic stop-the-world garbage collection events – it has predictable performance. C permits the use and implementation of different memory allocation schemes, including a typical malloc and free; a more sophisticated mechanism with arenas; or a version for an OS kernel that may suit DMA, use within interrupt handlers, or integrated with the virtual memory system. Depending on the linker and environment, C code can also call libraries written in assembly language, and may be called from assembly language – it interoperates well with other lower-level code. C and its calling conventions and linker structures are commonly used in conjunction with other high-level languages, with calls both to C and from C supported – it interoperates well with other high-level code. C has a very mature and broad ecosystem, including libraries, frameworks, open source compilers, debuggers and utilities, and is the de facto standard. It is likely the drivers already exist in C, or that there is a similar CPU architecture as a back-end of a C compiler, so there is reduced incentive to choose another language.\",\n",

      "  \"limitations\": \"the power of assembly language and the convenience of ... assembly language— Dennis Ritchie While C has been popular, influential and hugely successful, it has drawbacks, including: The standard dynamic memory handling with malloc and free is error prone. Improper use can lead to memory leaks and dangling pointers. The use of pointers and the direct manipulation of memory means corruption of memory is possible, perhaps due to programmer error, or insufficient checking of bad data. There is some type checking, but it does not apply to areas like variadic functions, and the type checking can be trivially or inadvertently circumvented. It is weakly typed. Since the code generated by the compiler contains few checks itself, there is a burden on the programmer to consider all possible outcomes, to protect against buffer overruns, array bounds checking, stack overflows, memory exhaustion, and consider race conditions, thread isolation, etc. The use of pointers and the run-time manipulation of these means there may be two ways to access the same data (aliasing), which is not determinable at compile time. This means that some optimisations that may be available to other languages are not possible in C. FORTRAN is considered faster. Some of the standard library functions, e.g. scanf or strncat, can lead to buffer overruns. There is limited standardisation in support for low-level variants in generated code, for example: different function calling conventions and ABI; different structure packing conventions; different byte ordering within larger integers (including endianness). In many language implementations, some of these options may be handled with the preprocessor directive #pragma, and some with additional keywords e.g. use __cdecl calling convention. The directive and options are not consistently supported. String handling using the standard library is code-intensive, with explicit memory management required. The language does not directly support object orientation, introspection, run-time expression evaluation, generics, etc. There are few guards against inappropriate use of language features, which may lead to unmaintainable code. In particular, the C preprocessor can hide troubling effects such as double evaluation and worse. This facility for tricky code has been celebrated with competitions such as the International Obfuscated C Code Contest and the Underhanded C Contest. C lacks standard support for exception handling and only offers return codes for error checking. The setjmp and longjmp standard library functions have been used to implement a try-catch mechanism via macros. For some purposes, restricted styles of C have been adopted, e.g. MISRA C or CERT C, in an attempt to reduce the opportunity for bugs. Databases such as CWE attempt to count the ways C etc. has vulnerabilities, along with recommendations for mitigation. There are tools that can mitigate against some of the drawbacks. Contemporary C compilers include checks which may generate warnings to help identify many potential bugs.\",\n",

The most pervasive influence has been syntactical; all of the languages mentioned combine the statement and (more or less recognizably) expression syntax of C with type systems, data models or large-scale program structures that differ from those of C, sometimes radically. Several C or near-C interpreters exist, including Ch and CINT, which can also be used for scripting. When object-oriented programming languages became popular, C++ and Objective-C were two different extensions of C that provided object-oriented capabilities. Both languages were originally implemented as source-to-source compilers; source code was translated into C, and then compiled with a C compiler. The C++ programming language (originally named C with Classes) was devised by Bjarne Stroustrup as an approach to providing object-oriented functionality with a C-like syntax. C++ adds greater typing strength, scoping, and other tools useful in object-oriented programming, and permits generic programming via templates. Nearly a superset of C, C++ now[when?] supports most of C, with a few exceptions. Objective-C was originally a very thin layer on top of C, and remains a strict superset of C that permits object-oriented programming using a hybrid dynamic/static typing paradigm. Objective-C derives its syntax from both C and Smalltalk: syntax that involves preprocessing, expressions, function declarations, and function calls is inherited from C, while the syntax for object-oriented features was originally taken from Smalltalk. In addition to C++ and Objective-C, Ch, Cilk, and Unified Parallel C are nearly supersets of C.\",\n",

      "  \"early_history\": \"PHP development began in 1993 when Rasmus Lerdorf wrote several Common Gateway Interface (CGI) programs in C, which he used to maintain his personal homepage. He extended them to work with web forms and to communicate with databases, and called this implementation Personal Home Page/Forms Interpreter or PHP/FI. An example of the early PHP syntax: <!--include /text/header.html--> <!--getenv HTTP_USER_AGENT--> <!--if substr $exec_result Mozilla--> Hey, you are using Netscape!<p> <!--endif--> <!--sql database select * from table where user='$username'--> <!--ifless $numentries 1--> Sorry, that record does not exist<p> <!--endif exit--> Welcome <!--$user-->!<p> You have <!--$index:0--> credits left in your account.<p> <!--include /text/footer.html--> PHP/FI could be used to build simple, dynamic web applications. To accelerate bug reporting and improve the code, Lerdorf initially announced the release of PHP/FI as Personal Home Page Tools (PHP Tools) version 1.0 on the Usenet discussion group comp.infosystems.www.authoring.cgi on 8 June 1995. This release included basic functionality such as Perl-like variables, form handling, and the ability to embed HTML. By this point, the syntax had changed to resemble that of Perl, but was simpler, more limited, and less consistent. Early PHP was never intended to be a new programming language; rather, it grew organically, with Lerdorf noting in retrospect: I don't know how to stop it [...] there was never any intent to write a programming language [...] I have absolutely no idea how to write a programming language [...] I just kept adding the next logical step on the way. A development team began to form and, after months of work and beta testing, officially released PHP/FI 2 in November 1997. The fact that PHP was not originally designed, but instead was developed organically has led to inconsistent naming of functions and inconsistent ordering of their parameters. In some cases, the function names were chosen to match the lower-level libraries which PHP was wrapping, while in some very early versions of PHP the length of the function names was used internally as a hash function, so names were chosen to improve the distribution of hash values.\",\n",
      "  \"php__and_\": \"This is an example of PHP code for the WordPress content management system. Zeev Suraski and Andi Gutmans rewrote the parser in 1997 and formed the base of PHP 3, changing the language's name to the recursive acronym PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor. Afterwards, public testing of PHP 3 began, and the official launch came in June 1998. Suraski and Gutmans then started a new rewrite of PHP's core, producing the Zend Engine in 1999. They also founded Zend Technologies in Ramat Gan, Israel. On 22 May 2000, PHP 4, powered by the Zend Engine 1.0, was released. By August 2008, this branch had reached version 4.4.9. PHP 4 is now no longer under development and nor are any security updates planned to be released.\",\n",
      "  \"php_\": \"PHP 8.4 was released on November 21, 2024.\",\n",
      "  \"php__and_unicode\": \"PHP received mixed reviews due to lacking native Unicode support at the core language level. In 2005, a project headed by Andrei Zmievski was initiated to bring native Unicode support throughout PHP, by embedding the International Components for Unicode (ICU) library, and representing text strings as UTF-16 internally. Since this would cause major changes both to the internals of the language and to user code, it was planned to release this as version 6.0 of the language, along with other major features then in development. However, a shortage of developers who understood the necessary changes, and performance problems arising from conversion to and from UTF-16, which is rarely used in a web context, led to delays in the project. As a result, a PHP 5.3 release was created in 2009, with many non-Unicode features back-ported from PHP 6, notably namespaces. In March 2010, the project in its current form was officially abandoned, and a PHP 5.4 release was prepared to contain most remaining non-Unicode features from PHP 6, such as traits and closure re-binding. Initial hopes were that a new plan would be formed for Unicode integration, but by 2014 none had been adopted.[citation needed]\",\n",
      "  \"just_in_time_compilation\": \"Just-in-time compilation is supported in PHP 8. PHP 8's JIT compiler can provide substantial performance improvements for some use cases, while (then PHP) developer Nikita Popov stated that the performance improvements for most websites will be less substantial than the upgrade from PHP 5 to PHP 7. Substantial improvements are expected more for mathematical-type operations than for common web-development use cases. Additionally, the JIT compiler provides the future potential to move some code from C to PHP, due to the performance improvements for some use cases.\",\n",
      "  \"addition_of_the_match_expression\": \"Main article: PHP syntax and semantics § Match expression PHP 8 introduced the match expression. The match expression is conceptually similar to a switch statement and is more compact for some use cases. Because match is an expression, its result can be assigned to a variable or returned from a function.\",\n",
      "  \"type_changes_and_additions\": \"PHP 8 introduced union types, a new static return type, and a new mixed type. Attributes, often referred to as annotations in other programming languages, were added in PHP 8, which allow metadata to be added to classes. throw was changed from being a statement to being an expression. This allows exceptions to be thrown in places that were not previously possible.\",\n",
      "  \"syntax_changes_and_additions\": \"PHP 8 includes changes to allow alternate, more concise, or more consistent syntaxes in a number of scenarios. For example, the nullsafe operator is similar to the null coalescing operator ??, but used when calling methods. The following code snippet will not throw an error if getBirthday() returns null: $human_readable_date = $user->getBirthday()?->diffForHumans(); Constructor property promotion has been added as syntactic sugar, allowing class properties to be set automatically when parameters are passed into a class constructor. This reduces the amount of boilerplate code that must be written. Other minor changes include support for use of ::class on objects, which serves as an alternative for the use of get_class(); non-capturing catches in try-catch blocks; variable syntax tweaks to resolve inconsistencies; support for named arguments; and support for trailing commas in parameter lists, which adds consistency with support for trailing commas in other contexts, such as in arrays.\",\n",
      "  \"standard_library_changes_and_additions\": \"Weak maps were added in PHP 8. A WeakMap holds references to objects, but these references do not prevent such objects from being garbage collected. This can provide performance improvements in scenarios where data is being cached; this is of particular relevance for object–relational mappings (ORM). Various adjustments to interfaces, such as adding support for creating DateTime objects from interfaces, and the addition of a Stringable interface that can be used for type hinting. Various new functions including str_contains(), str_starts_with(), and str_ends_with(); fdiv(); get_debug_type(); and get_resource_id() Object implementation of token_get_all()\",\n",
      "  \"additional_changes\": \"Type annotations were also added into PHP's C source code itself to allow internal functions and methods to have complete type information in reflection. Inheritance with private methods Abstract methods in traits improvements\",\n",

      "  \"mascot\": \"The elePHPant, PHP mascot The mascot of the PHP project is the elePHPant, a blue elephant with the PHP logo on its side, designed by Vincent Pontier in 1998. The (PHP) letters were forming the shape of an elephant if viewed in a sideways angle. The elePHPant is sometimes differently coloured when in plush toy form. Many variations of this mascot have been made over the years. Only the elePHPants based on the original design by Vincent Pontier are considered official by the community. These are collectable and some of them are extremely rare.\",\n",
      "  \"syntax\": \"Main article: PHP syntax and semantics A Hello, World application in PHP 7.4 running on its built-in development server The following Hello, World! program is written in PHP code embedded in an HTML document: <!DOCTYPE html> <html> <head> <title>PHP Hello, World! program</title> </head> <body> <p><?= 'Hello, World!' ?></p> </body> </html> However, as no requirement exists for PHP code to be embedded in HTML, the simplest version of Hello, World! may be written like this, with the closing tag ?> omitted as preferred in files containing pure PHP code. <?php echo 'Hello, World!'; The PHP interpreter only executes PHP code within its delimiters. Anything outside of its delimiters is not processed by PHP, although the non-PHP text is still subject to control structures described in PHP code. The most common delimiters are <?php to open and ?> to close PHP sections. The shortened form <? also exists. This short delimiter makes script files less portable since support for them can be disabled in the local PHP configuration and it is therefore discouraged. Conversely, there is no recommendation against the echo short tag <?=. Prior to PHP 5.4.0, this short syntax for echo only works with the short_open_tag configuration setting enabled, while for PHP 5.4.0 and later it is always available. The purpose of all these delimiters is to separate PHP code from non-PHP content, such as JavaScript code or HTML markup. So the shortest Hello, World! program written in PHP is: <?='Hello, World!'; The first form of delimiters, <?php and ?>, in XHTML and other XML documents, creates correctly formed XML processing instructions. This means that the resulting mixture of PHP code and other markups in the server-side file is itself well-formed XML. Variables are prefixed with a dollar symbol, and a type does not need to be specified in advance. PHP 5 introduced type declarations that allow functions to force their parameters to be objects of a specific class, arrays, interfaces or callback functions. However, before PHP 7, type declarations could not be used with scalar types such as integers or strings. Below is an example of how PHP variables are declared and initialized. <?php $name = 'John'; // variable of string type being declared and initialized $age = 18; // variable of integer type being declared and initialized $height = 5.3; // variable of double type being declared and initialized echo $name . ' is ' . $height . m tall\\\\n; // concatenating variables and strings echo $name is $age years old.; // interpolating variables to string ?> Unlike function and class names, variable names are case-sensitive. Both double-quoted () and heredoc strings provide the ability to interpolate a variable's value into the string. PHP treats newlines as whitespace in the manner of a free-form language, and statements are terminated by a semicolon. PHP has three types of comment syntax: /* */ marks block and inline comments; // or # are used for one-line comments. The echo statement is one of several facilities PHP provides to output text.[citation needed] In terms of keywords and language syntax, PHP is similar to C-style syntax. if conditions, for and while loops and function returns are similar in syntax to languages such as C, C++, C#, Java and Perl.[citation needed]\",\n",
      "  \"data_types\": \"PHP is loosely typed. It stores integers in a platform-dependent range, either as a 32, 64 or 128-bit signed integer equivalent to the C-language long type. Unsigned integers are converted to signed values in certain situations, which is different behaviour to many other programming languages. Integer variables can be assigned using decimal (positive and negative), octal, hexadecimal, and binary notations. Floating-point numbers are also stored in a platform-specific range. They can be specified using floating-point notation, or two forms of scientific notation. PHP has a native Boolean type that is similar to the native Boolean types in Java and C++. Using the Boolean type conversion rules, non-zero values are interpreted as true and zero as false, as in Perl and C++. The null data type represents a variable that has no value; NULL is the only allowed value for this data type. Variables of the resource type represent references to resources from external sources. These are typically created by functions from a particular extension, and can only be processed by functions from the same extension; examples include file, image, and database resources. Arrays can contain elements of any type that PHP can handle, including resources, objects, and even other arrays. Order is preserved in lists of values and in hashes with both keys and values, and the two can be intermingled. PHP also supports strings, which can be used with single quotes, double quotes, nowdoc or heredoc syntax. The Standard PHP Library (SPL) attempts to solve standard problems and implements efficient data access interfaces and classes.\",\n",
      "  \"functions\": \"PHP defines a large array of functions in the core language and many are also available in various extensions; these functions are well documented online PHP documentation. However, the built-in library has a wide variety of naming conventions and associated inconsistencies, as described under history above. Custom functions may be defined by the developer: function myAge(int $birthYear): string { // calculate the age by subtracting the birth year from the current year. $yearsOld = date('Y') - $birthYear; // return the age in a descriptive string. return $yearsOld . ($yearsOld == 1 ? ' year' : ' years'); } echo 'I am currently ' . myAge(1995) . ' old.'; As of 2025, the output of the above sample program is I am currently 30 years old. In lieu of function pointers, functions in PHP can be referenced by a string containing their name. In this manner, normal PHP functions can be used, for example, as callbacks or within function tables. User-defined functions may be created at any time without being prototyped. Functions may be defined inside code blocks, permitting a run-time decision as to whether or not a function should be defined. There is a function_exists function that determines whether a function with a given name has already been defined. Function calls must use parentheses, with the exception of zero-argument class constructor functions called with the PHP operator new, in which case parentheses are optional.[citation needed] Since PHP 4.0.1 create_function(), a thin wrapper around eval(), allowed normal PHP functions to be created during program execution; it was deprecated in PHP 7.2 and removed in PHP 8.0 in favor of syntax for anonymous functions or closures that can capture variables from the surrounding scope, which was added in PHP 5.3. Shorthand arrow syntax was added in PHP 7.4: function getAdder($x) { return fn($y) => $x + $y; } $adder = getAdder(8); echo $adder(2); // prints 10 In the example above, getAdder() function creates a closure using passed argument $x, which takes an additional argument $y, and returns the created closure to the caller. Such a function is a first-class object, meaning that it can be stored in a variable, passed as a parameter to other functions, etc. Unusually for a dynamically typed language, PHP supports type declarations on function parameters, which are enforced at runtime. This has been supported for classes and interfaces since PHP 5.0, for arrays since PHP 5.1, for callables since PHP 5.4, and scalar (integer, float, string and boolean) types since PHP 7.0. PHP 7.0 also has type declarations for function return types, expressed by placing the type name after the list of parameters, preceded by a colon. For example, the getAdder function from the earlier example could be annotated with types like so in PHP 7: function getAdder(int $x): Closure { return fn(int $y): int => $x + $y; } $adder = getAdder(8); echo $adder(2); // prints 10 echo $adder(null); // throws an exception because an incorrect type was passed $adder = getAdder([]); // would also throw an exception By default, scalar type declarations follow weak typing principles. So, for example, if a parameter's type is int, PHP would allow not only integers, but also convertible numeric strings, floats or Booleans to be passed to that function, and would convert them. However, PHP 7 has a strict typing mode which, when used, disallows such conversions for function calls and returns within a file.\",\n",
      "  \"php_objects\": \"Basic object-oriented programming functionality was added in PHP 3 and improved in PHP 4. This allowed for PHP to gain further abstraction, making creative tasks easier for programmers using the language. Object handling was completely rewritten for PHP 5, expanding the feature set and enhancing performance. In previous versions of PHP, objects were handled like value types. The drawback of this method was that code had to make heavy use of PHP's reference variables if it wanted to modify an object it was passed rather than creating a copy of it. In the new approach, objects are referenced by handle, and not by value.[citation needed] PHP 5 introduced private and protected member variables and methods, along with abstract classes, final classes, abstract methods, and final methods. It also introduced a standard way of declaring constructors and destructors, similar to that of other object-oriented languages such as C++, and a standard exception handling model. Furthermore, PHP 5 added interfaces and allowed for multiple interfaces to be implemented. There are special interfaces that allow objects to interact with the runtime system. Objects implementing ArrayAccess can be used with array syntax and objects implementing Iterator or IteratorAggregate can be used with the foreach language construct. There is no virtual table feature in the engine, so static variables are bound with a name instead of a reference at compile time. If the developer creates a copy of an object using the reserved word clone, the Zend engine will check whether a __clone() method has been defined. If not, it will call a default __clone() which will copy the object's properties. If a __clone() method is defined, then it will be responsible for setting the necessary properties in the created object. For convenience, the engine will supply a function that imports the properties of the source object, so the programmer can start with a by-value replica of the source object and only override properties that need to be changed. The visibility of PHP properties and methods is defined using the keywords public, private, and protected. The default is public, if only var is used; var is a synonym for public. Items declared public can be accessed everywhere. protected limits access to inherited classes (and to the class that defines the item). private limits visibility only to the class that defines the item. Objects of the same type have access to each other's private and protected members even though they are not the same instance.[citation needed]\",\n",
      "  \"example\": \"The following is a basic example of object-oriented programming in PHP 8: <?php abstract class User { protected string $name; public function __construct(string $name) { // make first letter uppercase and the rest lowercase $this->name = ucfirst(strtolower($name)); } public function greet(): string { return Hello, my name is  . $this->name; } abstract public function job(): string; } class Student extends User { public function __construct(string $name, private string $course) { parent::__construct($name); } public function job(): string { return I learn  . $this->course; } } class Teacher extends User { public function __construct(string $name, private array $teachingCourses) { parent::__construct($name); } public function job(): string { return I teach  . implode(, , $this->teachingCourses); } } $students = [ new Student(Alice, Computer Science), new Student(Bob, Computer Science), new Student(Charlie, Business Studies), ]; $teachers = [ new Teacher(Dan, [Computer Science, Information Security]), new Teacher(Erin, [Computer Science, 3D Graphics Programming]), new Teacher(Frankie, [Online Marketing, Business Studies, E-commerce]), ]; foreach ([$students, $teachers] as $users) { echo $users::class . s:\\\\n; array_walk($users, function (User $user) { echo {$user->greet()}, {$user->job()}\\\\n; }); } This program outputs the following: Students: Hello, my name is Alice, I learn Computer Science Hello, my name is Bob, I learn Computer Science Hello, my name is Charlie, I learn Business Studies Teachers: Hello, my name is Dan, I teach Computer Science, Information Security Hello, my name is Erin, I teach Computer Science, 3D Graphics Programming Hello, my name is Frankie, I teach Online Marketing, Business Studies, E-commerce\",\n",
      "  \"implementations\": \"The only complete PHP implementation is the original, known simply as PHP. It is the most widely used and is powered by the Zend Engine. To disambiguate it from other implementations, it is sometimes unofficially called Zend PHP. The Zend Engine compiles PHP source code on-the-fly into an internal format that it can execute, thus it works as an interpreter. It is also the reference implementation of PHP, as PHP has no formal specification, and so the semantics of Zend PHP define the semantics of PHP. Due to the complex and nuanced semantics of PHP, defined by how Zend works, it is difficult for competing implementations to offer complete compatibility. PHP's single-request-per-script-execution model, and the fact that the Zend Engine is an interpreter, leads to inefficiency; as a result, various products have been developed to help improve PHP performance. In order to speed up execution time and not have to compile the PHP source code every time the web page is accessed, PHP scripts can also be deployed in the PHP engine's internal format by using an opcode cache, which works by caching the compiled form of a PHP script (opcodes) in shared memory to avoid the overhead of parsing and compiling the code every time the script runs. An opcode cache, Zend Opcache, is built into PHP since version 5.5. Another example of a widely used opcode cache is the Alternative PHP Cache (APC), which is available as a PECL extension. While Zend PHP is still the most popular implementation, several other implementations have been developed. Some of these are compilers or support JIT compilation, and hence offer performance benefits over Zend PHP at the expense of lacking full PHP compatibility.[citation needed] Alternative implementations include the following: HHVM (HipHop Virtual Machine) – developed at Facebook and available as open source, it converts PHP code into a high-level bytecode (commonly known as an intermediate language), which is then translated into x86-64 machine code dynamically at runtime by a just-in-time (JIT) compiler, resulting in up to 6× performance improvements. However, since version 7.2 Zend has outperformed HHVM, and HHVM 3.24 is the last version to officially support PHP. HipHop – developed at Facebook and available as open source, it transforms the PHP scripts into C++ code and then compiles the resulting code, reducing the server load up to 50%. In early 2013, Facebook deprecated it in favour of HHVM due to multiple reasons, including deployment difficulties and lack of support for the whole PHP language, including the create_function() and eval() constructs. Parrot – a virtual machine designed to run dynamic languages efficiently; the cross-translator Pipp transforms the PHP source code into the Parrot intermediate representation, which is then translated into the Parrot's bytecode and executed by the virtual machine. PeachPie – a second-generation compiler to .NET Common Intermediate Language (CIL) bytecode, built on the Roslyn platform; successor of Phalanger, sharing several architectural components Phalanger – compiles PHP into .Net Common Intermediate Language bytecode; predecessor of PeachPie Quercus – compiles PHP into Java bytecode\",\n",
      "  \"licensing\": \"Main article: PHP License PHP is free software released under the PHP License, which stipulates that: Products derived from this software may not be called PHP, nor may PHP appear in their name, without prior written permission from group@php.net. You may indicate that your software works in conjunction with PHP by saying Foo for PHP instead of calling it PHP Foo or phpfoo. This restriction on the use of PHP makes the PHP License incompatible with the GNU General Public License (GPL), while the Zend License is incompatible due to an advertising clause similar to that of the original BSD license.\",\n",
      "  \"development_and_community\": \"PHP includes various free and open-source libraries in its source distribution or uses them in resulting PHP binary builds. PHP is fundamentally an Internet-aware system with built-in modules for accessing File Transfer Protocol (FTP) servers and many database servers, including PostgreSQL, MySQL, Microsoft SQL Server and SQLite (which is an embedded database), LDAP servers, and others. Numerous functions are familiar to C programmers, such as those in the stdio family, are available in standard PHP builds. PHP allows developers to write extensions in C to add functionality to the PHP language. PHP extensions can be compiled statically into PHP or loaded dynamically at runtime. Numerous extensions have been written to add support for the Windows API, process management on Unix-like operating systems, multibyte strings (Unicode), cURL, and several popular compression formats. Other PHP features made available through extensions include integration with Internet Relay Chat (IRC), dynamic generation of images and Adobe Flash content, PHP Data Objects (PDO) as an abstraction layer used for accessing databases, and even speech synthesis. Some of the language's core functions, such as those dealing with strings and arrays, are also implemented as extensions. The PHP Extension Community Library (PECL) project is a repository for extensions to the PHP language. Some other projects, such as Zephir, provide the ability for PHP extensions to be created in a high-level language and compiled into native PHP extensions. Such an approach, instead of writing PHP extensions directly in C, simplifies the development of extensions and reduces the time required for programming and testing. By December 2018 the PHP Group consisted of ten people: Thies C. Arntzen, Stig Bakken, Shane Caraveo, Andi Gutmans, Rasmus Lerdorf, Sam Ruby, Sascha Schumann, Zeev Suraski, Jim Winstead, and Andrei Zmievski. Zend Technologies provides a PHP Certification based on PHP 8 exam (and previously based on PHP 7 and 5.5) for programmers to become certified PHP developers.\",\n",

Roman Pronskiy, a member of the foundation's board, said that they aim to pay market salaries to developers. The response to the foundation has mostly been positive, with the foundation being praised for better supporting the language and helping to stop the decrease in the language's popularity. However, it has also been criticised for adding breaking changes to minor versions of PHP, such as in PHP 8.2 where initialising members of a class out-with the original class scope would cause deprecation errors, these changes impacted a number of open source projects including WordPress. Germany's Sovereign Tech Fund provided more than 200,000 Euros to support the PHP Foundation.\",\n",
      "  \"installation_and_configuration\": \"Example output of the phpinfo() function in PHP 7.1 There are two primary ways for adding support for PHP to a web server – as a native web server module, or as a CGI executable. PHP has a direct module interface called server application programming interface (SAPI), which is supported by many web servers including Apache HTTP Server, Microsoft IIS and iPlanet Web Server. Some other web servers, such as OmniHTTPd, support the Internet Server Application Programming Interface (ISAPI), which is Microsoft's web server module interface. If PHP has no module support for a web server, it can always be used as a Common Gateway Interface (CGI) or FastCGI processor; in that case, the web server is configured to use PHP's CGI executable to process all requests to PHP files. PHP-FPM (FastCGI Process Manager) is an alternative FastCGI implementation for PHP, bundled with the official PHP distribution since version 5.3.3. When compared to the older FastCGI implementation, it contains some additional features, mostly useful for heavily loaded web servers. When using PHP for command-line scripting, a PHP command-line interface (CLI) executable is needed. PHP supports a CLI server application programming interface (SAPI) since PHP 4.3.0. The main focus of this SAPI is developing shell applications using PHP. There are quite a few differences between the CLI SAPI and other SAPIs, although they do share many of the same behaviours. PHP has a direct module interface called SAPI for different web servers; in case of PHP 5 and Apache 2.0 on Windows, it is provided in form of a DLL file called php5apache2.dll, which is a module that, among other functions, provides an interface between PHP and the web server, implemented in a form that the server understands. This form is what is known as a SAPI.[citation needed] There are different kinds of SAPIs for various web server extensions. For example, in addition to those listed above, other SAPIs for the PHP language include the Common Gateway Interface and command-line interface. PHP can also be used for writing desktop graphical user interface (GUI) applications, by using the PHP Desktop. GitHub. or discontinued PHP-GTK extension. PHP-GTK is not included in the official PHP distribution, and as an extension, it can be used only with PHP versions 5.1.0 and newer. The most common way of installing PHP-GTK is by compiling it from the source code. When PHP is installed and used in cloud environments, software development kits (SDKs) are provided for using cloud-specific features.[citation needed] For example: Amazon Web Services provides the AWS SDK for PHP Microsoft Azure can be used with the Windows Azure SDK for PHP. Numerous configuration options are supported, affecting both core PHP features and extensions. Configuration file php.ini is searched for in different locations, depending on the way PHP is used. The configuration file is split into various sections, while some of the configuration options can be also set within the web server configuration.\",\n",
      "  \"use\": \"A broad overview of the LAMP software bundle, displayed here together with Squid PHP is a general-purpose scripting language that is especially suited to server-side web development, in which case PHP generally runs on a web server. Any PHP code in a requested file is executed by the PHP runtime, usually to create dynamic web page content or dynamic images used on websites or elsewhere. It can also be used for command-line scripting and client-side graphical user interface (GUI) applications. PHP can be deployed on most web servers, many operating systems and platforms, and can be used with many relational database management systems (RDBMS). Most web hosting providers support PHP for use by their clients. It is available free of charge, and the PHP Group provides the complete source code for users to build, customize and extend for their own use. Dynamic web page: example of server-side scripting (PHP and MySQL) Originally designed to create dynamic web pages, PHP now focuses mainly on server-side scripting, and it is similar to other server-side scripting languages that provide dynamic content from a web server to a client, such as Python, Microsoft's ASP.NET, Sun Microsystems' JavaServer Pages, and mod_perl. PHP has also attracted the development of many software frameworks that provide building blocks and a design structure to promote rapid application development (RAD).[citation needed] Some of these include PRADO, CakePHP, Symfony, CodeIgniter, Laravel, Yii Framework, Phalcon and Laminas, offering features similar to other web frameworks. The LAMP architecture has become popular in the web industry as a way of deploying web applications. PHP is commonly used as the P in this bundle alongside Linux, Apache and MySQL, although the P may also refer to Python, Perl, or some mix of the three. Similar packages, WAMP and MAMP, are also available for Windows and macOS, with the first letter standing for the respective operating system. Although both PHP and Apache are provided as part of the macOS base install, users of these packages seek a simpler installation mechanism that can be more easily kept up to date.[citation needed] For specific and more advanced usage scenarios, PHP offers a well-defined and documented way for writing custom extensions in C or C++.[non-primary source needed] Besides extending the language itself in form of additional libraries, extensions are providing a way for improving execution speed where it is critical and there is room for improvements by using a true compiled language. PHP also offers well-defined ways for embedding itself into other software projects. That way PHP can be easily used as an internal scripting language for another project, also providing tight interfacing with the project's specific internal data structures. PHP received mixed reviews due to lacking support for multithreading at the core language level, though using threads is made possible by the pthreads PECL extension. A command line interface, php-cli, and two ActiveX Windows Script Host scripting engines for PHP have been produced.[citation needed]\",\n",

      "  \"security\": \"In 2019, 11% of all vulnerabilities listed by the National Vulnerability Database were linked to PHP; historically, about 30% of all vulnerabilities listed since 1996 in this database are linked to PHP. Technical security flaws of the language itself or of its core libraries are not frequent (22 in 2009, about 1% of the total although PHP applies to about 20% of programs listed). Recognizing that programmers make mistakes, some languages include taint checking to automatically detect the lack of input validation which induces many issues. Such a feature has been proposed for PHP in the past, but either been rejected or the proposal abandoned. Third-party projects such as Suhosin and Snuffleupagus aim to remove or change dangerous parts of the language. Historically, old versions of PHP had some configuration parameters and default values for such runtime settings that made some PHP applications prone to security issues. Among these, magic_quotes_gpc and register_globals configuration directives were the best known; the latter made any URL parameters become PHP variables, opening a path for serious security vulnerabilities by allowing an attacker to set the value of any uninitialized global variable and interfere with the execution of a PHP script. Support for magic quotes and register globals settings has been deprecated since PHP 5.3.0, and removed from PHP 5.4.0. Another example for the potential runtime-settings vulnerability comes from failing to disable PHP execution (for example by using the engine configuration directive) for the directory where uploaded files are stored; enabling it can result in the execution of malicious code embedded within the uploaded files. The best practice is to either locate the image directory outside of the document root available to the web server and serve it via an intermediary script or disable PHP execution for the directory which stores the uploaded files.[citation needed] Also, enabling the dynamic loading of PHP extensions (via enable_dl configuration directive) in a shared web hosting environment can lead to security issues. Implied type conversions that result in different values being treated as equal, sometimes against the programmer's intent, can lead to security issues. For example, the result of the comparison '0e1234' == '0' is true, because strings that are parsable as numbers are converted to numbers; in this case, the first compared value is treated as scientific notation having the value (0×101234), which is zero. Errors like this resulted in authentication vulnerabilities in Simple Machines Forum, Typo3 and phpBB when MD5 password hashes were compared. The recommended way is to use hash_equals() (for timing attack safety), strcmp or the identity operator (===), as '0e1234' === '0' results in false.[citation needed] In a 2013 analysis of over 170,000 website defacements, published by Zone-H, the most frequently (53%) used technique was the exploitation of file inclusion vulnerability, mostly related to insecure usage of the PHP language constructs include, require, and allow_url_fopen.\",\n",

The language, and implementations thereof, should provide support for software engineering principles such as strong type checking, array bounds checking,: 58–59 detection of attempts to use uninitialized variables, and automatic garbage collection.: 563 Software robustness, durability, and programmer productivity are important. The language is intended for use in developing software components suitable for deployment in distributed environments. Portability is very important for source code and programmers, especially those already familiar with C and C++. Support for internationalization: 314 is very important. C# is intended to be suitable for writing applications for both hosted and embedded systems, ranging from the very large that use sophisticated operating systems, down to the very small having dedicated functions. Although C# applications are intended to be economical with regard to memory and processing power requirements, the language was not intended to compete directly on performance and size with C or assembly language.\",\n",
      "  \"history\": \"C#'s former logos During the development of the .NET Framework, the class libraries were originally written using a managed code compiler system named Simple Managed C (SMC). In January 1999, Anders Hejlsberg formed a team to build a new language at the time called COOL, which stood for C-like Object Oriented Language. Microsoft had considered keeping the name COOL(C-like Object Oriented Language) as the final name of the language, but chose not to do so for trademark reasons. By the time the .NET project was publicly announced at the July 2000 Professional Developers Conference, the language had been renamed C#, and the class libraries and ASP.NET runtime were ported to C#. Hejlsberg is C#'s principal designer and lead architect at Microsoft, and was previously involved with the design of Turbo Pascal, Embarcadero Delphi (formerly CodeGear Delphi, Inprise Delphi and Borland Delphi), and Visual J++. In interviews and technical papers, he has stated that flaws in most major programming languages (e.g. C++, Java, Delphi, and Smalltalk) drove the fundamentals of the Common Language Runtime (CLR), which, in turn, drove the design of the C# language. James Gosling, who created the Java programming language in 1994, and Bill Joy, a co-founder of Sun Microsystems, the originator of Java, called C# an imitation of Java; Gosling further said that [C# is] sort of Java with reliability, productivity and security deleted. In July 2000, Hejlsberg said that C# is not a Java clone and is much closer to C++ in its design. Since the release of C# 2.0 in November 2005, the C# and Java languages have evolved on increasingly divergent trajectories, becoming two quite different languages. One of the first major departures came with the addition of generics to both languages, with vastly different implementations. C# uses of reification to provide first-class generic objects that can be used like any other class, with code generation performed at class-load time. Furthermore, C# has added several major features to accommodate functional-style programming, culminating in the LINQ extensions released with C# 3.0 and its supporting framework of lambda expressions, extension methods, and anonymous types. These features enable C# programmers to use functional programming techniques, such as closures, when it is advantageous to their application. The LINQ extensions and the functional imports help developers reduce the amount of boilerplate code included in common tasks such as querying a database, parsing an XML file, or searching through a data structure, shifting the emphasis onto the actual program logic to help improve readability and maintainability. C# used to have a mascot called Andy (named after Anders Hejlsberg). It was retired on January 29, 2004. C# was originally submitted to the ISO/IEC JTC 1 subcommittee SC 22 for review, under ISO/IEC 23270:2003, was withdrawn and was then approved under ISO/IEC 23270:2006. The 23270:2006 is withdrawn under 23270:2018 and approved with this version.\",\n",
      "  \"name\": \"Microsoft first used the name C# in 1988 for a variant of the C language designed for incremental compilation. That project was not completed, and the name was later reused. C-sharp musical note The name C sharp was inspired by the musical notation whereby a sharp symbol indicates that the written note should be made a semitone higher in pitch. This is similar to the language name of C++, where ++ indicates that a variable should be incremented by 1 after being evaluated. The sharp symbol also resembles a ligature of four + symbols (in a two-by-two grid), further implying that the language is an increment of C++. Due to technical limits of display (standard fonts, browsers, etc.), and most keyboard layouts lacking a sharp symbol (U+266F ♯ MUSIC SHARP SIGN (&sharp;)), the number sign (U+0023 # NUMBER SIGN (&num;)) was chosen to approximate the sharp symbol in the written name of the programming language. This convention is reflected in the ECMA-334 C# Language Specification. The sharp suffix has been used by a number of other Microsoft .NET compatible/compliant languages that are variants of existing languages, including J# (a .NET language also designed by Microsoft that is derived from Java 1.1), A# (from Ada), and the functional programming language F#. The original implementation of Eiffel for .NET was called Eiffel#, a name retired since the full Eiffel language is now supported. The suffix has also been used for libraries, such as Gtk# (a .NET wrapper for GTK and other GNOME libraries) and Cocoa# (a wrapper for Cocoa).\",\n",

      "  \"syntax\": \"Main article: C# syntax See also: Syntax (programming languages) The core syntax of the C# language is similar to that of other C-style languages such as C, Objective-C, C++ and Java, particularly: Semicolons are used to denote the end of a statement. Curly brackets are used to group statements. Statements are commonly grouped into methods (functions), methods into classes, and classes into namespaces. Variables are assigned using an equals sign, but compared using two consecutive equals signs. Square brackets are used with arrays, both to declare them and to get a value at a given index in one of them. class, int and void are used to define large-scale (usually main) program functions in scripts most of the time in C-style computer programming languages.\",\n",
      "  \"distinguishing_features\": \"See also: Comparison of C# and Java Some notable features of C# that distinguish it from C, C++, and Java where noted, are:\",\n",
      "  \"portability\": \"By design, C# is the programming language that most directly reflects the underlying Common Language Infrastructure (CLI). Most of its intrinsic types correspond to value-types implemented by the CLI (Common Language Infrastructure) framework. However, the language specification does not state the code generation requirements of the compiler: that is, it does not state that a C# compiler must target a Common Language Runtime (CLR), or generate Common Intermediate Language (CIL), or generate any other specific format. Some C# compilers can also generate machine code like traditional compilers of Objective-C, C, C++, Assembly and Fortran.\",\n",
      "  \"typing\": \"C# supports strongly, implicitly typed variable declarations with the keyword var,: 470 and implicitly typed arrays with the keyword new[] followed by a collection initializer.: 80 : 58 Its type system is split into two families: Value types, like the built-in numeric types and user-defined structs, which are automatically handed over as copies when used as parameters, and reference types, including arrays, instances of classes, and strings, which only hand over a pointer to the respective object. Due to their special handling of the equality operator and their immutability, strings will nevertheless behave as if they were values, for all practical purposes. You can even use them as case labels. Where necessary, value types will be boxed automatically. C# supports a strict Boolean data type, bool. Statements that take conditions, such as while and if, require an expression of a type that implements the true operator, such as the Boolean type. While C++ also has a Boolean type, it can be freely converted to and from integers, and expressions such as if (a) require only that a is convertible to bool, allowing a to be an int, or a pointer. C# disallows this integer meaning true or false approach, on the grounds that forcing programmers to use expressions that return exactly bool can prevent certain types of programming mistakes such as if (a = b) (use of assignment = instead of equality ==). C# is more type safe than C++. The only implicit conversions by default are those that are considered safe, such as widening of integers. This is enforced at compile-time, during JIT, and, in some cases, at runtime. No implicit conversions occur between Booleans and integers, nor between enumeration members and integers (except for literal 0, which can be implicitly converted to any enumerated type). Any user-defined conversion must be explicitly marked as explicit or implicit, unlike C++ copy constructors and conversion operators, which are both implicit by default. C# has explicit support for covariance and contravariance in generic types,: 144 : 23 unlike C++ which has some degree of support for contravariance simply through the semantics of return types on virtual methods. Enumeration members are placed in their own scope. The C# language does not allow for global variables or functions. All methods and members must be declared within classes. Static members of public classes can substitute for global variables and functions. Local variables cannot shadow variables of the enclosing block, unlike C and C++, but may shadow type-level names.\",\n",
      "  \"metaprogramming\": \"Metaprogramming can be achieved in several ways: Reflection is supported through .NET APIs, which enable scenarios such as type metadata inspection and dynamic method invocation. Expression trees represent code as an abstract syntax tree, where each node is an expression that can be inspected or executed. This enables dynamic modification of executable code at runtime. Expression trees introduce some homoiconicity to the language. Attributes, in C# parlance, are metadata that can be attached to types, members, or entire assemblies, equivalent to annotations in Java. Attributes are accessible both to the compiler and to code through reflection, allowing them to adjust their behaviour. Many of the native attributes duplicate the functionality of GCC's and VisualC++'s platform-dependent preprocessor directives.[citation needed] System.Reflection.Emit namespace, which contains classes that emit metadata and CIL (types, assemblies, etc.) at runtime. The .NET Compiler Platform (Roslyn) provides API access to language compilation services, allowing for the compilation of C# code from within .NET applications. It exposes APIs for syntactic (lexical) analysis of code, semantic analysis, dynamic compilation to CIL, and code emission. Source generators, a feature of the Roslyn C# compiler, enable compile time metaprogramming. During the compilation process, developers can inspect the code being compiled with the compiler's API and pass additional generated C# source code to be compiled.\",\n",
      "  \"methods_and_functions\": \"A method in C# is a member of a class that can be invoked as a function (a sequence of instructions), rather than the mere value-holding capability of a field (i.e. class or instance variable). As in other syntactically similar languages, such as C++ and ANSI C, the signature of a method is a declaration comprising in order: any optional accessibility keywords (such as private), the explicit specification of its return type (such as int, or the keyword void if no value is returned), the name of the method, and finally, a parenthesized sequence of comma-separated parameter specifications, each consisting of a parameter's type, its formal name and optionally, a default value to be used whenever none is provided. Different from most other languages, call-by-reference parameters have to be marked both at the function definition and at the calling site, and you can choose between ref and out, the latter allowing handing over an uninitialized variable which will have a definite value on return. Additionally, you can specify a variable-sized argument list by applying the params keyword to the last parameter. Certain specific kinds of methods, such as those that simply get or set a field's value by returning or assigning it, do not require an explicitly stated full signature, but in the general case, the definition of a class includes the full signature declaration of its methods. Like C++, and unlike Java, C# programmers must use the scope modifier keyword virtual to allow methods to be overridden by subclasses. Unlike C++, you have to explicitly specify the keyword override when doing so. This is supposed to avoid confusion between overriding and newly overloading a function (i.e. hiding the former implementation). To do the latter, you have to specify the new keyword. You can use the keyword sealed to disallow further overrides for individual methods or whole classes. Extension methods in C# allow programmers to use static methods as if they were methods from a class's method table, allowing programmers to virtually add instance methods to a class that they feel should exist on that kind of objects (and instances of the respective derived classes).: 103–105 : 202–203 The type dynamic allows for run-time method binding, allowing for JavaScript-like method calls and run-time object composition.: 114–118 C# has support for strongly-typed function pointers via the keyword delegate. Like the Qt framework's pseudo-C++ signal and slot, C# has semantics specifically surrounding publish-subscribe style events, though C# uses delegates to do so. C# offers Java-like synchronized method calls, via the attribute [MethodImpl(MethodImplOptions.Synchronized)], and has support for mutually-exclusive locks via the keyword lock.\",\n",
      "  \"property\": \"C# supports classes with properties. The properties can be simple accessor functions with a backing field, or implement arbitrary getter and setter functions. A property is read-only if there's no setter. Like with fields, there can be class and instance properties. The underlying methods can be virtual or abstract like any other method. Since C# 3.0 the syntactic sugar of auto-implemented properties is available, where the accessor (getter) and mutator (setter) encapsulate operations on a single field of a class.\",\n",
      "  \"namespace\": \"A C# namespace provides the same level of code isolation as a Java package or a C++ namespace, with very similar rules and features to a package. Namespaces can be imported with the using syntax.\",\n",
      "  \"memory_access\": \"In C#, memory address pointers can only be used within blocks specifically marked as unsafe, and programs with unsafe code need appropriate permissions to run. Most object access is done through safe object references, which always either point to a live object or have the well-defined null value; it is impossible to obtain a reference to a dead object (one that has been garbage collected), or to an arbitrary block of memory. An unsafe pointer can point to an instance of an unmanaged value type that does not contain any references to objects subject to garbage collections such as class instances, arrays or strings. Code that is not marked as unsafe can still store and manipulate pointers through the System.IntPtr type, but it cannot dereference them. Managed memory cannot be explicitly freed; instead, it is automatically garbage collected. Garbage collection addresses the problem of memory leaks by freeing the programmer of responsibility for releasing memory that is no longer needed in most cases. Code that retains references to objects longer than is required can still experience higher memory usage than necessary, however once the final reference to an object is released the memory is available for garbage collection.\",\n",
      "  \"exceptions\": \"A range of standard exceptions are available to programmers. Methods in standard libraries regularly throw system exceptions in some circumstances and the range of exceptions thrown is normally documented. Custom exception classes can be defined for classes allowing handling to be put in place for particular circumstances as needed. The syntax for handling exceptions is the following: try { // something } catch (Exception ex) { // if error do this } finally { // always executes, regardless of error occurrence } Most of the time people call this a try-catch code block, because of the try and catch functions being used and accessible on all C# versions. try { // something here } catch (Exception ex) { // example return 0; } finally { return 1; } Depending on your plans, the finally part can be left out. If error handling is not required, the (Exception ex) parameter can be omitted as well. Also, there can be several catch parts handling different kinds of exceptions. Checked exceptions are not present in C# (in contrast to Java). This has been a conscious decision based on the issues of scalability and version management.\",\n",
      "  \"polymorphism\": \"Unlike C++, C# does not support multiple inheritance, although a class can implement any number of interfaces (fully abstract classes). This was a design decision by the language's lead architect to avoid complications and to simplify architectural requirements throughout CLI. When implementing multiple interfaces that contain a method with the same name and taking parameters of the same type in the same order (i.e. the same signature), similar to Java, C# allows both a single method to cover all interfaces and if necessary specific methods for each interface. C# also offers function overloading (a.k.a. ad-hoc-polymorphism), i.e. methods with the same name, but distinguishable signatures. Unlike Java, C# additionally supports operator overloading. Since version 2.0, C# offers parametric polymorphism, i.e. classes with arbitrary or constrained type parameters, e.g. List<T>, a variable-sized array which only can contain elements of type T. There are certain kinds of constraints you can specify for the type parameters: Has to be type X (or one derived from it), has to implement a certain interface, has to be a reference type, has to be a value type, has to implement a public parameterless constructor. Most of them can be combined, and you can specify any number of interfaces.\",\n",
      "  \"language_integrated_query_linq\": \"C# has the ability to utilize LINQ through the .NET Framework. A developer can query a variety of data sources, provided the IEnumerable<T> interface is implemented on the object. This includes XML documents, an ADO.NET dataset, and SQL databases. Using LINQ in C# brings advantages like IntelliSense support, strong filtering capabilities, type safety with compile error checking ability, and consistency for querying data over a variety of sources. There are several different language structures that can be utilized with C# and LINQ and they are query expressions, lambda expressions, anonymous types, implicitly typed variables, extension methods, and object initializers. LINQ has two syntaxes: query syntax and method syntax. However, the compiler always converts the query syntax to method syntax at compile time. using System.Linq; var numbers = new int[] { 5, 10, 8, 3, 6, 12 }; // Query syntax (SELECT num FROM numbers WHERE num % 2 = 0 ORDER BY num) var numQuery1 = from num in numbers where num % 2 == 0 orderby num select num; // Method syntax var numQuery2 = numbers .Where(num => num % 2 == 0) .OrderBy(n => n);\",\n",
      "  \"functional_programming\": \"Though primarily an imperative language, C# always adds functional features over time, for example: Functions as first-class citizen – C# 1.0 delegates Higher-order functions – C# 1.0 together with delegates Anonymous functions – C# 2 anonymous delegates and C# 3 lambdas expressions Closures – C# 2 together with anonymous delegates and C# 3 together with lambdas expressions Type inference – C# 3 with implicitly typed local variables var and C# 9 target-typed new expressions new() List comprehension – C# 3 LINQ Tuples – .NET Framework 4.0 but it becomes popular when C# 7.0 introduced a new tuple type with language support Nested functions – C# 7.0 Pattern matching – C# 7.0 Immutability – C# 7.2 readonly struct C# 9 record types and Init only setters Type classes – C# 12 roles/extensions (in development)\",\n",
      "  \"common_type_system\": \"C# has a unified type system. This unified type system is called Common Type System (CTS).: Part 2, Chapter 4: The Type System A unified type system implies that all types, including primitives such as integers, are subclasses of the System.Object class. For example, every type inherits a ToString() method.\",\n",
      "  \"categories_of_data_types\": \"CTS separates data types into two categories: Reference types Value types Instances of value types neither have referential identity nor referential comparison semantics. Equality and inequality comparisons for value types compare the actual data values within the instances, unless the corresponding operators are overloaded. Value types are derived from System.ValueType, always have a default value, and can always be created and copied. Some other limitations on value types are that they cannot derive from each other (but can implement interfaces) and cannot have an explicit default (parameterless) constructor because they already have an implicit one which initializes all contained data to the type-dependent default value (0, null, or alike). Examples of value types are all primitive types, such as int (a signed 32-bit integer), float (a 32-bit IEEE floating-point number), char (a 16-bit Unicode code unit), decimal (fixed-point numbers useful for handling currency amounts), and System.DateTime (identifies a specific point in time with nanosecond precision). Other examples are enum (enumerations) and struct (user defined structures). In contrast, reference types have the notion of referential identity, meaning that each instance of a reference type is inherently distinct from every other instance, even if the data within both instances is the same. This is reflected in default equality and inequality comparisons for reference types, which test for referential rather than structural equality, unless the corresponding operators are overloaded (such as the case for System.String). Some operations are not always possible, such as creating an instance of a reference type, copying an existing instance, or performing a value comparison on two existing instances. Nevertheless, specific reference types can provide such services by exposing a public constructor or implementing a corresponding interface (such as ICloneable or IComparable). Examples of reference types are object (the ultimate base class for all other C# classes), System.String (a string of Unicode characters), and System.Array (a base class for all C# arrays). Both type categories are extensible with user-defined types.\",\n",
      "  \"boxing_and_unboxing\": \"Boxing is the operation of converting a value-type object into a value of a corresponding reference type. Boxing in C# is implicit. Unboxing is the operation of converting a value of a reference type (previously boxed) into a value of a value type. Unboxing in C# requires an explicit type cast. A boxed object of type T can only be unboxed to a T (or a nullable T). Example: int foo = 42; // Value type. object bar = foo; // foo is boxed to bar. int foo2 = (int)bar; // Unboxed back to value type.\",\n",
      "  \"libraries\": \"The C# specification details a minimum set of types and class libraries that the compiler expects to have available. In practice, C# is most often used with some implementation of the Common Language Infrastructure (CLI), which is standardized as ECMA-335 Common Language Infrastructure (CLI). In addition to the standard CLI specifications, there are many commercial and community class libraries that build on top of the .NET framework libraries to provide additional functionality. C# can make calls to any library included in the List of .NET libraries and frameworks.\",\n",
      "  \"hello_world\": \"The following is a very simple C# program, a version of the classic Hello world example using the top-level statements feature introduced in C# 9: System.Console.WriteLine(Hello, world!); For code written as C# 8 or lower, the entry point logic of a program must be written in a Main method inside a type: using System; class Program { static void Main() { Console.WriteLine(Hello, world!); } } This code will display this text in the console window: Hello, world! Each line has a purpose: using System; The above line imports all types in the System namespace. For example, the Console class used later in the source code is defined in the System namespace, meaning it can be used without supplying the full name of the type (which includes the namespace). // A version of the classic Hello World program This line is a comment; it describes and documents the code for the programmer(s). class Program Above is a class definition for the Program class. Everything that follows between the pair of braces describes that class. { ... } The curly brackets demarcate the boundaries of a code block. In this first instance, they are marking the start and end of the Program class. static void Main() This declares the class member method where the program begins execution. The .NET runtime calls the Main method. Unlike in Java, the Main method does not need the public keyword, which tells the compiler that the method can be called from anywhere by any class. Writing static void Main(string[] args) is equivalent to writing private static void Main(string[] args). The static keyword makes the method accessible without an instance of Program. Each console application's Main entry point must be declared static otherwise the program would require an instance of Program, but any instance would require a program. To avoid that irresolvable circular dependency, C# compilers processing console applications (like that above) report an error if there is no static Main method. The void keyword declares that Main has no return value. (Note, however, that short programs can be written using Top Level Statements introduced in C# 9, as mentioned earlier.) Console.WriteLine(Hello, world!); This line writes the output. Console is a static class in the System namespace. It provides an interface to the standard input/output, and error streams for console applications. The program calls the Console method WriteLine, which displays on the console a line with the argument, the string Hello, world!.\",\n",
      "  \"generics\": \"Further information: Generic programming With .NET 2.0 and C# 2.0, the community got more flexible collections than those in .NET 1.x. In the absence of generics, developers had to use collections such as ArrayList to store elements as objects of unspecified kind, which incurred performance overhead when boxing/unboxing/type-checking the contained items. Generics introduced a massive new feature in .NET that allowed developers to create type-safe data structures. This shift is particularly important in the context of converting legacy systems, where updating to generics can significantly enhance performance and maintainability by replacing outdated data structures with more efficient, type-safe alternatives. Example public class DataStore<T> { private T[] items = new T; private int count = 0; public void Add(T item) { items[count++] = item; } public T Get(int index) { return items[index]; } }\",\n",
      "  \"standardization_and_licensing\": \"In August 2001, Microsoft, Hewlett-Packard and Intel co-sponsored the submission of specifications for C# as well as the Common Language Infrastructure (CLI) to the standards organization Ecma International. In December 2001, ECMA released ECMA-334 C# Language Specification. C# became an ISO/IEC standard in 2003 (ISO/IEC 23270:2003 - Information technology — Programming languages — C#). ECMA had previously adopted equivalent specifications as the 2nd edition of C#, in December 2002. In June 2005, ECMA approved edition 3 of the C# specification, and updated ECMA-334. Additions included partial classes, anonymous methods, nullable types, and generics (somewhat similar to C++ templates). In July 2005, ECMA submitted to ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 22, via the latter's Fast-Track process, the standards and related TRs. This process usually takes 6–9 months. The C# language definition and the CLI are standardized under ISO/IEC and Ecma standards that provide reasonable and non-discriminatory licensing protection from patent claims. Microsoft initially agreed not to sue open-source developers for violating patents in non-profit projects for the part of the framework that is covered by the Open Specification Promise. Microsoft has also agreed not to enforce patents relating to Novell products against Novell's paying customers with the exception of a list of products that do not explicitly mention C#, .NET or Novell's implementation of .NET (The Mono Project). However, Novell maintained that Mono does not infringe any Microsoft patents. Microsoft also made a specific agreement not to enforce patent rights related to the Moonlight browser plugin, which depends on Mono, provided it is obtained through Novell. A decade later, Microsoft began developing free, open-source, and cross-platform tooling for C#, namely Visual Studio Code, .NET Core, and Roslyn. Mono joined Microsoft as a project of Xamarin, a Microsoft subsidiary.\",\n",
      "  \"implementations\": \"Microsoft has developed open-source reference C# compilers and tools. The first compiler, Roslyn, compiles into intermediate language (IL), and the second one, RyuJIT, is a JIT (just-in-time) compiler, which is dynamic and does on-the-fly optimization and compiles the IL into native code for the front-end of the CPU. RyuJIT is open source and written in C++. Roslyn is entirely written in managed code (C#), has been opened up and functionality surfaced as APIs. It is thus enabling developers to create refactoring and diagnostics tools. Two branches of official implementation are .NET Framework (closed-source, Windows-only) and .NET Core (open-source, cross-platform); they eventually converged into one open-source implementation: .NET 5.0. At .NET Framework 4.6, a new JIT compiler replaced the former. Other C# compilers (some of which include an implementation of the Common Language Infrastructure and .NET class libraries): Mono, a Microsoft-sponsored project provides an open-source C# compiler, a complete open-source implementation of the CLI (including the required framework libraries as they appear in the ECMA specification,) and a nearly complete implementation of the NET class libraries up to .NET Framework 3.5. The Elements tool chain from RemObjects includes RemObjects C#, which compiles C# code to .NET's Common Intermediate Language, Java bytecode, Cocoa, Android bytecode, WebAssembly, and native machine code for Windows, macOS, and Linux. The DotGNU project (now discontinued) also provided an open-source C# compiler, a nearly complete implementation of the Common Language Infrastructure including the required framework libraries as they appear in the ECMA specification, and subset of some of the remaining Microsoft proprietary .NET class libraries up to .NET 2.0 (those not documented or included in the ECMA specification, but included in Microsoft's standard .NET Framework distribution). The Unity game engine uses C# as its primary scripting language. The Godot game engine has implemented an optional C# module due to a donation of $24,000 from Microsoft.\",\n",

      "  \"assembly_language_syntax\": \"Assembly language uses a mnemonic to represent, e.g., each low-level machine instruction or opcode, each directive, typically also each architectural register, flag, etc. Some of the mnemonics may be built-in and some user-defined. Many operations require one or more operands in order to form a complete instruction. Most assemblers permit named constants, registers, and labels for program and memory locations, and can calculate expressions for operands. Thus, programmers are freed from tedious repetitive calculations and assembler programs are much more readable than machine code. Depending on the architecture, these elements may also be combined for specific instructions or addressing modes using offsets or other data as well as fixed addresses. Many assemblers offer additional mechanisms to facilitate program development, to control the assembly process, and to aid debugging. Some are column oriented, with specific fields in specific columns; this was very common for machines using punched cards in the 1950s and early 1960s. Some assemblers have free-form syntax, with fields separated by delimiters, e.g., punctuation, white space. Some assemblers are hybrid, with, e.g., labels, in a specific column and other fields separated by delimiters; this became more common than column-oriented syntax in the 1960s.\",\n",
      "  \"terminology\": \"A macro assembler is an assembler that includes a macroinstruction facility so that (parameterized) assembly language text can be represented by a name, and that name can be used to insert the expanded text into other code. Open code refers to any assembler input outside of a macro definition. A cross assembler (see also cross compiler) is an assembler that is run on a computer or operating system (the host system) of a different type from the system on which the resulting code is to run (the target system). Cross-assembling facilitates the development of programs for systems that do not have the resources to support software development, such as an embedded system or a microcontroller. In such a case, the resulting object code must be transferred to the target system, via read-only memory (ROM, EPROM, etc.), a programmer (when the read-only memory is integrated in the device, as in microcontrollers), or a data link using either an exact bit-by-bit copy of the object code or a text-based representation of that code (such as Intel hex or Motorola S-record). A high-level assembler is a program that provides language abstractions more often associated with high-level languages, such as advanced control structures (IF/THEN/ELSE, DO CASE, etc.) and high-level abstract data types, including structures/records, unions, classes, and sets. A microassembler is a program that helps prepare a microprogram to control the low level operation of a computer. A meta-assembler is a program that accepts the syntactic and semantic description of an assembly language, and generates an assembler for that language, or that accepts an assembler source file along with such a description and assembles the source file in accordance with that description. Meta-Symbol assemblers for the SDS 9 Series and SDS Sigma series of computers are meta-assemblers. Sperry Univac also provided a Meta-Assembler for the UNIVAC 1100/2200 series. inline assembler (or embedded assembler) is assembler code contained within a high-level language program. This is most often used in systems programs which need direct access to the hardware.\",\n",
      "  \"assembler\": \"An assembler program creates object code by translating combinations of mnemonics and syntax for operations and addressing modes into their numerical equivalents. This representation typically includes an operation code (opcode) as well as other control bits and data. The assembler also calculates constant expressions and resolves symbolic names for memory locations and other entities. The use of symbolic references is a key feature of assemblers, saving tedious calculations and manual address updates after program modifications. Most assemblers also include macro facilities for performing textual substitution – e.g., to generate common short sequences of instructions as inline, instead of called subroutines. Some assemblers may also be able to perform some simple types of instruction set-specific optimizations. One concrete example of this may be the ubiquitous x86 assemblers from various vendors. Called jump-sizing, most of them are able to perform jump-instruction replacements (long jumps replaced by short or relative jumps) in any number of passes, on request. Others may even do simple rearrangement or insertion of instructions, such as some assemblers for RISC architectures that can help optimize a sensible instruction scheduling to exploit the CPU pipeline as efficiently as possible. Assemblers have been available since the 1950s, as the first step above machine language and before high-level programming languages such as Fortran, Algol, COBOL and Lisp. There have also been several classes of translators and semi-automatic code generators with properties similar to both assembly and high-level languages, with Speedcode as perhaps one of the better-known examples. There may be several assemblers with different syntax for a particular CPU or instruction set architecture. For instance, an instruction to add memory data to a register in a x86-family processor might be add eax,[ebx], in original Intel syntax, whereas this would be written addl (%ebx),%eax in the AT&T syntax used by the GNU Assembler. Despite different appearances, different syntactic forms generally generate the same numeric machine code. A single assembler may also have different modes in order to support variations in syntactic forms as well as their exact semantic interpretations (such as FASM-syntax, TASM-syntax, ideal mode, etc., in the special case of x86 assembly programming).\",\n",
      "  \"number_of_passes\": \"There are two types of assemblers based on how many passes through the source are needed (how many times the assembler reads the source) to produce the object file. One-pass assemblers process the source code once. For symbols used before they are defined, the assembler will emit errata after the eventual definition, telling the linker or the loader to patch the locations where the as yet undefined symbols had been used. Multi-pass assemblers create a table with all symbols and their values in the first passes, then use the table in later passes to generate code. In both cases, the assembler must be able to determine the size of each instruction on the initial passes in order to calculate the addresses of subsequent symbols. This means that if the size of an operation referring to an operand defined later depends on the type or distance of the operand, the assembler will make a pessimistic estimate when first encountering the operation, and if necessary, pad it with one or more no-operation instructions in a later pass or the errata. In an assembler with peephole optimization, addresses may be recalculated between passes to allow replacing pessimistic code with code tailored to the exact distance from the target. The original reason for the use of one-pass assemblers was memory size and speed of assembly – often a second pass would require storing the symbol table in memory (to handle forward references), rewinding and rereading the program source on tape, or rereading a deck of cards or punched paper tape. Later computers with much larger memories (especially disc storage), had the space to perform all necessary processing without such re-reading. The advantage of the multi-pass assembler is that the absence of errata makes the linking process (or the program load if the assembler directly produces executable code) faster. Example: in the following code snippet, a one-pass assembler would be able to determine the address of the backward reference BKWD when assembling statement S2, but would not be able to determine the address of the forward reference FWD when assembling the branch statement S1; indeed, FWD may be undefined. A two-pass assembler would determine both addresses in pass 1, so they would be known when generating code in pass 2. S1 B FWD ... FWD EQU * ... BKWD EQU * ... S2 B BKWD\",\n",

      "  \"assembly_language\": \"A program written in assembly language consists of a series of mnemonic processor instructions and meta-statements (known variously as declarative operations, directives, pseudo-instructions, pseudo-operations and pseudo-ops), comments and data. Assembly language instructions usually consist of an opcode mnemonic followed by an operand, which might be a list of data, arguments or parameters. Some instructions may be implied, which means the data upon which the instruction operates is implicitly defined by the instruction itself—such an instruction does not take an operand. The resulting statement is translated by an assembler into machine language instructions that can be loaded into memory and executed. For example, the instruction below tells an x86/IA-32 processor to move an immediate 8-bit value into a register. The binary code for this instruction is 10110 followed by a 3-bit identifier for which register to use. The identifier for the AL register is 000, so the following machine code loads the AL register with the data 01100001. 10110000 01100001 This binary computer code can be made more human-readable by expressing it in hexadecimal as follows. B0 61 Here, B0 means Move a copy of the following value into AL, and 61 is a hexadecimal representation of the value 01100001, which is 97 in decimal. Assembly language for the 8086 family provides the mnemonic MOV (an abbreviation of move) for instructions such as this, so the machine code above can be written as follows in assembly language, complete with an explanatory comment if required, after the semicolon. This is much easier to read and to remember. MOV AL, 61h ; Load AL with 97 decimal (61 hex) In some assembly languages (including this one) the same mnemonic, such as MOV, may be used for a family of related instructions for loading, copying and moving data, whether these are immediate values, values in registers, or memory locations pointed to by values in registers or by immediate (a.k.a. direct) addresses. Other assemblers may use separate opcode mnemonics such as L for move memory to register, ST for move register to memory, LR for move register to register, MVI for move immediate operand to memory, etc. If the same mnemonic is used for different instructions, that means that the mnemonic corresponds to several different binary instruction codes, excluding data (e.g. the 61h in this example), depending on the operands that follow the mnemonic. For example, for the x86/IA-32 CPUs, the Intel assembly language syntax MOV AL, AH represents an instruction that moves the contents of register AH into register AL. The[nb 3] hexadecimal form of this instruction is: 88 E0 The first byte, 88h, identifies a move between a byte-sized register and either another register or memory, and the second byte, E0h, is encoded (with three bit-fields) to specify that both operands are registers, the source is AH, and the destination is AL. In a case like this where the same mnemonic can represent more than one binary instruction, the assembler determines which instruction to generate by examining the operands. In the first example, the operand 61h is a valid hexadecimal numeric constant and is not a valid register name, so only the B0 instruction can be applicable. In the second example, the operand AH is a valid register name and not a valid numeric constant (hexadecimal, decimal, octal, or binary), so only the 88 instruction can be applicable. Assembly languages are always designed so that this sort of lack of ambiguity is universally enforced by their syntax. For example, in the Intel x86 assembly language, a hexadecimal constant must start with a numeral digit, so that the hexadecimal number 'A' (equal to decimal ten) would be written as 0Ah or 0AH, not AH, specifically so that it cannot appear to be the name of register AH. (The same rule also prevents ambiguity with the names of registers BH, CH, and DH, as well as with any user-defined symbol that ends with the letter H and otherwise contains only characters that are hexadecimal digits, such as the word BEACH.) Returning to the original example, while the x86 opcode 10110000 (B0) copies an 8-bit value into the AL register, 10110001 (B1) moves it into CL and 10110010 (B2) does so into DL. Assembly language examples for these follow. MOV AL, 1h ; Load AL with immediate value 1 MOV CL, 2h ; Load CL with immediate value 2 MOV DL, 3h ; Load DL with immediate value 3 The syntax of MOV can also be more complex as the following examples show. MOV EAX, [EBX] ; Move the 4 bytes in memory at the address contained in EBX into EAX MOV [ESI+EAX], CL ; Move the contents of CL into the byte at address ESI+EAX MOV DS, DX ; Move the contents of DX into segment register DS In each case, the MOV mnemonic is translated directly into one of the opcodes 88-8C, 8E, A0-A3, B0-BF, C6 or C7 by an assembler, and the programmer normally does not have to know or remember which. Transforming assembly language into machine code is the job of an assembler, and the reverse can at least partially be achieved by a disassembler. Unlike high-level languages, there is a one-to-one correspondence between many simple assembly statements and machine language instructions. However, in some cases, an assembler may provide pseudoinstructions (essentially macros) which expand into several machine language instructions to provide commonly needed functionality. For example, for a machine that lacks a branch if greater or equal instruction, an assembler may provide a pseudoinstruction that expands to the machine's set if less than and branch if zero (on the result of the set instruction). Most full-featured assemblers also provide a rich macro language (discussed below) which is used by vendors and programmers to generate more complex code and data sequences. Since the information about pseudoinstructions and macros defined in the assembler environment is not present in the object program, a disassembler cannot reconstruct the macro and pseudoinstruction invocations but can only disassemble the actual machine instructions that the assembler generated from those abstract assembly-language entities. Likewise, since comments in the assembly language source file are ignored by the assembler and have no effect on the object code it generates, a disassembler is always completely unable to recover source comments. Each computer architecture has its own machine language. Computers differ in the number and type of operations they support, in the different sizes and numbers of registers, and in the representations of data in storage. While most general-purpose computers are able to carry out essentially the same functionality, the ways they do so differ; the corresponding assembly languages reflect these differences. Multiple sets of mnemonics or assembly-language syntax may exist for a single instruction set, typically instantiated in different assembler programs. In these cases, the most popular one is usually that supplied by the CPU manufacturer and used in its documentation. Two examples of CPUs that have two different sets of mnemonics are the Intel 8080 family and the Intel 8086/8088. Because Intel claimed copyright on its assembly language mnemonics (on each page of their documentation published in the 1970s and early 1980s, at least), some companies that independently produced CPUs compatible with Intel instruction sets invented their own mnemonics. The Zilog Z80 CPU, an enhancement of the Intel 8080A, supports all the 8080A instructions plus many more; Zilog invented an entirely new assembly language, not only for the new instructions but also for all of the 8080A instructions. For example, where Intel uses the mnemonics MOV, MVI, LDA, STA, LXI, LDAX, STAX, LHLD, and SHLD for various data transfer instructions, the Z80 assembly language uses the mnemonic LD for all of them. A similar case is the NEC V20 and V30 CPUs, enhanced copies of the Intel 8086 and 8088, respectively. Like Zilog with the Z80, NEC invented new mnemonics for all of the 8086 and 8088 instructions, to avoid accusations of infringement of Intel's copyright. (It is questionable whether such copyrights can be valid, and later CPU companies such as AMD[nb 4] and Cyrix republished Intel's x86/IA-32 instruction mnemonics exactly with neither permission nor legal penalty.) It is doubtful whether in practice many people who programmed the V20 and V30 actually wrote in NEC's assembly language rather than Intel's; since any two assembly languages for the same instruction set architecture are isomorphic (somewhat like English and Pig Latin), there is no requirement to use a manufacturer's own published assembly language with that manufacturer's products.\",\n",
      "  \"basic_elements\": \"There is a large degree of diversity in the way the authors of assemblers categorize statements and in the nomenclature that they use. In particular, some describe anything other than a machine mnemonic or extended mnemonic as a pseudo-operation (pseudo-op). A typical assembly language consists of 3 types of instruction statements that are used to define program operations: Opcode mnemonics Data definitions Assembly directives\",\n",
      "  \"opcode_mnemonics_and_extended_mnemonics\": \"Instructions (statements) in assembly language are generally very simple, unlike those in high-level languages. Generally, a mnemonic is a symbolic name for a single executable machine language instruction (an opcode), and there is at least one opcode mnemonic defined for each machine language instruction. Each instruction typically consists of an operation or opcode plus zero or more operands. Most instructions refer to a single value or a pair of values. Operands can be immediate (value coded in the instruction itself), registers specified in the instruction or implied, or the addresses of data located elsewhere in storage. This is determined by the underlying processor architecture: the assembler merely reflects how this architecture works. Extended mnemonics are often used to specify a combination of an opcode with a specific operand, e.g., the System/360 assemblers use B as an extended mnemonic for BC with a mask of 15 and NOP (NO OPeration – do nothing for one step) for BC with a mask of 0. Extended mnemonics are often used to support specialized uses of instructions, often for purposes not obvious from the instruction name. For example, many CPU's do not have an explicit NOP instruction, but do have instructions that can be used for the purpose. In 8086 CPUs the instruction xchg ax,ax is used for nop, with nop being a pseudo-opcode to encode the instruction xchg ax,ax. Some disassemblers recognize this and will decode the xchg ax,ax instruction as nop. Similarly, IBM assemblers for System/360 and System/370 use the extended mnemonics NOP and NOPR for BC and BCR with zero masks. For the SPARC architecture, these are known as synthetic instructions. Some assemblers also support simple built-in macro-instructions that generate two or more machine instructions. For instance, with some Z80 assemblers the instruction ld hl,bc is recognized to generate ld l,c followed by ld h,b. These are sometimes known as pseudo-opcodes. Mnemonics are arbitrary symbols; in 1985 the IEEE published Standard 694 for a uniform set of mnemonics to be used by all assemblers. The standard has since been withdrawn.\",\n",
      "  \"data_directives\": \"There are instructions used to define data elements to hold data and variables. They define the type of data, the length and the alignment of data. These instructions can also define whether the data is available to outside programs (programs assembled separately) or only to the program in which the data section is defined. Some assemblers classify these as pseudo-ops.\",\n",
      "  \"assembly_directives\": \"Assembly directives, also called pseudo-opcodes, pseudo-operations or pseudo-ops, are commands given to an assembler directing it to perform operations other than assembling instructions. Directives affect how the assembler operates and may affect the object code, the symbol table, the listing file, and the values of internal assembler parameters. Sometimes the term pseudo-opcode is reserved for directives that generate object code, such as those that generate data. The names of pseudo-ops often start with a dot to distinguish them from machine instructions. Pseudo-ops can make the assembly of the program dependent on parameters input by a programmer, so that one program can be assembled in different ways, perhaps for different applications. Or, a pseudo-op can be used to manipulate presentation of a program to make it easier to read and maintain. Another common use of pseudo-ops is to reserve storage areas for run-time data and optionally initialize their contents to known values. Symbolic assemblers let programmers associate arbitrary names (labels or symbols) with memory locations and various constants. Usually, every constant and variable is given a name so instructions can reference those locations by name, thus promoting self-documenting code. In executable code, the name of each subroutine is associated with its entry point, so any calls to a subroutine can use its name. Inside subroutines, GOTO destinations are given labels. Some assemblers support local symbols which are often lexically distinct from normal symbols (e.g., the use of 10$ as a GOTO destination). Some assemblers, such as NASM, provide flexible symbol management, letting programmers manage different namespaces, automatically calculate offsets within data structures, and assign labels that refer to literal values or the result of simple computations performed by the assembler. Labels can also be used to initialize constants and variables with relocatable addresses. Assembly languages, like most other computer languages, allow comments to be added to program source code that will be ignored during assembly. Judicious commenting is essential in assembly language programs, as the meaning and purpose of a sequence of binary machine instructions can be difficult to determine. The raw (uncommented) assembly language generated by compilers or disassemblers is quite difficult to read when changes must be made.\",\n",
      "  \"macros\": \"Many assemblers support predefined macros, and others support programmer-defined (and repeatedly re-definable) macros involving sequences of text lines in which variables and constants are embedded. The macro definition is most commonly[nb 5] a mixture of assembler statements, e.g., directives, symbolic machine instructions, and templates for assembler statements. This sequence of text lines may include opcodes or directives. Once a macro has been defined its name may be used in place of a mnemonic. When the assembler processes such a statement, it replaces the statement with the text lines associated with that macro, then processes them as if they existed in the source code file (including, in some assemblers, expansion of any macros existing in the replacement text). Macros in this sense date to IBM autocoders of the 1950s. Macro assemblers typically have directives to, e.g., define macros, define variables, set variables to the result of an arithmetic, logical or string expression, iterate, conditionally generate code. Some of those directives may be restricted to use within a macro definition, e.g., MEXIT in HLASM, while others may be permitted within open code (outside macro definitions), e.g., AIF and COPY in HLASM. In assembly language, the term macro represents a more comprehensive concept than it does in some other contexts, such as the pre-processor in the C programming language, where its #define directive typically is used to create short single line macros. Assembler macro instructions, like macros in PL/I and some other languages, can be lengthy programs by themselves, executed by interpretation by the assembler during assembly. Since macros can have 'short' names but expand to several or indeed many lines of code, they can be used to make assembly language programs appear to be far shorter, requiring fewer lines of source code, as with higher level languages. They can also be used to add higher levels of structure to assembly programs, optionally introduce embedded debugging code via parameters and other similar features. Macro assemblers often allow macros to take parameters. Some assemblers include quite sophisticated macro languages, incorporating such high-level language elements as optional parameters, symbolic variables, conditionals, string manipulation, and arithmetic operations, all usable during the execution of a given macro, and allowing macros to save context or exchange information. Thus a macro might generate numerous assembly language instructions or data definitions, based on the macro arguments. This could be used to generate record-style data structures or unrolled loops, for example, or could generate entire algorithms based on complex parameters. For instance, a sort macro could accept the specification of a complex sort key and generate code crafted for that specific key, not needing the run-time tests that would be required for a general procedure interpreting the specification. An organization using assembly language that has been heavily extended using such a macro suite can be considered to be working in a higher-level language since such programmers are not working with a computer's lowest-level conceptual elements. Underlining this point, macros were used to implement an early virtual machine in SNOBOL4 (1967), which was written in the SNOBOL Implementation Language (SIL), an assembly language for a virtual machine. The target machine would translate this to its native code using a macro assembler. This allowed a high degree of portability for the time. Macros were used to customize large scale software systems for specific customers in the mainframe era and were also used by customer personnel to satisfy their employers' needs by making specific versions of manufacturer operating systems. This was done, for example, by systems programmers working with IBM's Conversational Monitor System / Virtual Machine (VM/CMS) and with IBM's real time transaction processing add-ons, Customer Information Control System CICS, and ACP/TPF, the airline/financial system that began in the 1970s and still runs many large computer reservation systems (CRS) and credit card systems today. It is also possible to use solely the macro processing abilities of an assembler to generate code written in completely different languages, for example, to generate a version of a program in COBOL using a pure macro assembler program containing lines of COBOL code inside assembly time operators instructing the assembler to generate arbitrary code. IBM OS/360 uses macros to perform system generation. The user specifies options by coding a series of assembler macros. Assembling these macros generates a job stream to build the system, including job control language and utility control statements. This is because, as was realized in the 1960s, the concept of macro processing is independent of the concept of assembly, the former being in modern terms more word processing, text processing, than generating object code. The concept of macro processing appeared, and appears, in the C programming language, which supports preprocessor instructions to set variables, and make conditional tests on their values. Unlike certain previous macro processors inside assemblers, the C preprocessor is not Turing-complete because it lacks the ability to either loop or go to, the latter allowing programs to loop. Despite the power of macro processing, it fell into disuse in many high level languages (major exceptions being C, C++ and PL/I) while remaining a perennial for assemblers. Macro parameter substitution is strictly by name: at macro processing time, the value of a parameter is textually substituted for its name. The most famous class of bugs resulting was the use of a parameter that itself was an expression and not a simple name when the macro writer expected a name. In the macro: foo: macro a load a*b the intention was that the caller would provide the name of a variable, and the global variable or constant b would be used to multiply a. If foo is called with the parameter a-c, the macro expansion of load a-c*b occurs. To avoid any possible ambiguity, users of macro processors can parenthesize formal parameters inside macro definitions, or callers can parenthesize the input parameters.\",\n",
      "  \"support_for_structured_programming\": \"Packages of macros have been written providing structured programming elements to encode execution flow. The earliest example of this approach was in the Concept-14 macro set, originally proposed by Harlan Mills (March 1970), and implemented by Marvin Kessler at IBM's Federal Systems Division, which provided IF/ELSE/ENDIF and similar control flow blocks for OS/360 assembler programs. This was a way to reduce or eliminate the use of GOTO operations in assembly code, one of the main factors causing spaghetti code in assembly language. This approach was widely accepted in the early 1980s (the latter days of large-scale assembly language use). IBM's High Level Assembler Toolkit includes such a macro package. Another design was A-Natural, a stream-oriented assembler for 8080/Z80 processors from Whitesmiths Ltd. (developers of the Unix-like Idris operating system, and what was reported to be the first commercial C compiler). The language was classified as an assembler because it worked with raw machine elements such as opcodes, registers, and memory references; but it incorporated an expression syntax to indicate execution order. Parentheses and other special symbols, along with block-oriented structured programming constructs, controlled the sequence of the generated instructions. A-natural was built as the object language of a C compiler, rather than for hand-coding, but its logical syntax won some fans. There has been little apparent demand for more sophisticated assemblers since the decline of large-scale assembly language development. In spite of that, they are still being developed and applied in cases where resource constraints or peculiarities in the target system's architecture prevent the effective use of higher-level languages. Assemblers with a strong macro engine allow structured programming via macros, such as the switch macro provided with the Masm32 package (this code is a complete program): include \\\\masm32\\\\include\\\\masm32rt.inc ; use the Masm32 library .code demomain: REPEAT 20 switch rv(nrandom, 9) ; generate a number between 0 and 8 mov ecx, 7 case 0 print case 0 case ecx ; in contrast to most other programming languages, print case 7 ; the Masm32 switch allows variable cases case 1 .. 3 .if eax==1 print case 1 .elseif eax==2 print case 2 .else print cases 1 to 3: other .endif case 4, 6, 8 print cases 4, 6 or 8 default mov ebx, 19 ; print 20 stars .Repeat print * dec ebx .Until Sign? ; loop until the sign flag is set endsw print chr$(13, 10) ENDM exit end demomain\",\n",
      "  \"use_of_assembly_language\": \"When the stored-program computer was introduced, programs were written in machine code, and loaded into the computer from punched paper tape or toggled directly into memory from console switches.[citation needed] Kathleen Booth is credited with inventing assembly language based on theoretical work she began in 1947, while working on the ARC2 at Birkbeck, University of London, following consultation by Andrew Booth (later her husband) with mathematician John von Neumann and physicist Herman Goldstine at the Institute for Advanced Study. In late 1948, the Electronic Delay Storage Automatic Calculator (EDSAC) had an assembler (named initial orders) integrated into its bootstrap program. It used one-letter mnemonics developed by David Wheeler, who is credited by the IEEE Computer Society as the creator of the first assembler. Reports on the EDSAC introduced the term assembly for the process of combining fields into an instruction word. SOAP (Symbolic Optimal Assembly Program) was an assembly language for the IBM 650 computer written by Stan Poley in 1955. Assembly languages eliminated much of the error-prone, tedious, and time-consuming first-generation programming needed with the earliest computers, freeing programmers from tedium such as remembering numeric codes and calculating addresses. They were once widely used for all sorts of programming. By the late 1950s their use had largely been supplanted by higher-level languages in the search for improved programming productivity. Today, assembly language is still used for direct hardware manipulation, access to specialized processor instructions, or to address critical performance issues. Typical uses are device drivers, low-level embedded systems, and real-time systems (see § Current usage). Numerous programs were written entirely in assembly language. The Burroughs MCP (1961) was the first computer for which an operating system was not developed entirely in assembly language; it was written in Executive Systems Problem Oriented Language (ESPOL), an Algol dialect. Many commercial applications were written in assembly language as well, including a large amount of the IBM mainframe software developed by large corporations. COBOL, FORTRAN and some PL/I eventually displaced assembly language, although a number of large organizations retained assembly-language application infrastructures well into the 1990s. Assembly language was the primary development language for 8-bit home computers such as the Apple II, Atari 8-bit computers, ZX Spectrum, and Commodore 64. Interpreted BASIC on these systems did not offer maximum execution speed and full use of facilities to take full advantage of the available hardware. Assembly language was the default choice for programming 8-bit consoles such as the Atari 2600 and Nintendo Entertainment System. Key software for IBM PC compatibles such as MS-DOS, Turbo Pascal, and the Lotus 1-2-3 spreadsheet was written in assembly language. As computer speed grew exponentially, assembly language became a tool for speeding up parts of programs, such as the rendering of Doom, rather than a dominant development language. In the 1990s, assembly language was used to maximise performance from systems such as the Sega Saturn, and as the primary language for arcade hardware using the TMS34010 integrated CPU/GPU such as Mortal Kombat and NBA Jam.\",\n",
      "  \"current_usage\": \"There has been debate over the usefulness and performance of assembly language relative to high-level languages. Although assembly language has specific niche uses where it is important (see below), there are other tools for optimization. As of July 2017[update], the TIOBE index of programming language popularity ranks assembly language at 11, ahead of Visual Basic, for example. Assembler can be used to optimize for speed or optimize for size. In the case of speed optimization, modern optimizing compilers are claimed to render high-level languages into code that can run as fast as hand-written assembly, despite some counter-examples. The complexity of modern processors and memory sub-systems makes effective optimization increasingly difficult for compilers and assembly programmers alike. Increasing processor performance has meant that most CPUs sit idle most of the time, with delays caused by predictable bottlenecks such as cache misses, I/O operations and paging, making raw code execution speed a non-issue for many programmers. There are still certain computer programming domains in which the use of assembly programming is more common: Writing code for systems with older processors[clarification needed] that have limited high-level language options such as the Atari 2600, Commodore 64, and graphing calculators. Programs for these computers of the 1970s and 1980s are often written in the context of demoscene or retrogaming subcultures. Code that must interact directly with the hardware, for example in device drivers and interrupt handlers. In an embedded processor or DSP, high-repetition interrupts require the shortest number of cycles per interrupt, such as an interrupt that occurs 1000 or 10000 times a second. Programs that need to use processor-specific instructions not implemented in a compiler. A common example is the bitwise rotation instruction at the core of many encryption algorithms, as well as querying the parity of a byte or the 4-bit carry of an addition. Stand-alone executables that are required to execute without recourse to the run-time components or libraries associated with a high-level language, such as the firmware for telephones, automobile fuel and ignition systems, air-conditioning control systems, and security systems. Programs with performance-sensitive inner loops, where assembly language provides optimization opportunities that are difficult to achieve in a high-level language. For example, linear algebra with BLAS or discrete cosine transformation (e.g. SIMD assembly version from x264). Programs that create vectorized functions for programs in higher-level languages such as C. In the higher-level language this is sometimes aided by compiler intrinsic functions which map directly to SIMD mnemonics, but nevertheless result in a one-to-one assembly conversion specific for the given vector processor. Real-time programs such as simulations, flight navigation systems, and medical equipment. For example, in a fly-by-wire system, telemetry must be interpreted and acted upon within strict time constraints. Such systems must eliminate sources of unpredictable delays, which may be created by interpreted languages, automatic garbage collection, paging operations, or preemptive multitasking. Choosing assembly or lower-level languages for such systems gives programmers greater visibility and control over processing details. Cryptographic algorithms that must always take strictly the same time to execute, preventing timing attacks. Video encoders and decoders such as rav1e (an encoder for AV1) and dav1d (the reference decoder for AV1) contain assembly to leverage AVX2 and ARM Neon instructions when available. Modify and extend legacy code written for IBM mainframe computers. Situations where complete control over the environment is required, in extremely high-security situations where nothing can be taken for granted. Computer viruses, bootloaders, certain device drivers, or other items very close to the hardware or low-level operating system. Instruction set simulators for monitoring, tracing and debugging where additional overhead is kept to a minimum. Situations where no high-level language exists, on a new or specialized processor for which no cross compiler is available. Reverse engineering and modifying program files such as: existing binaries that may or may not have originally been written in a high-level language, for example when trying to recreate programs for which source code is not available or has been lost, or cracking copy protection of proprietary software. Video games (also termed ROM hacking), which is possible via several methods. The most widely employed method is altering program code at the assembly language level. Assembly language is still taught in most computer science and electronic engineering programs. Although few programmers today regularly work with assembly language as a tool, the underlying concepts remain important. Such fundamental topics as binary arithmetic, memory allocation, stack processing, character set encoding, interrupt processing, and compiler design would be hard to study in detail without a grasp of how a computer operates at the hardware level. Since a computer's behaviour is fundamentally defined by its instruction set, the logical way to learn such concepts is to study an assembly language. Most modern computers have similar instruction sets. Therefore, studying a single assembly language is sufficient to learn the basic concepts, recognize situations where the use of assembly language might be appropriate, and to see how efficient executable code can be created from high-level languages.\",\n",
      "  \"typical_applications\": \"Assembly language is typically used in a system's boot code, the low-level code that initializes and tests the system hardware prior to booting the operating system and is often stored in ROM. (BIOS on IBM-compatible PC systems and CP/M is an example.) Assembly language is often used for low-level code, for instance for operating system kernels, which cannot rely on the availability of pre-existing system calls and must indeed implement them for the particular processor architecture on which the system will be running. Some compilers translate high-level languages into assembly first before fully compiling, allowing the assembly code to be viewed for debugging and optimization purposes. Some compilers for relatively low-level languages, such as Pascal or C, allow the programmer to embed assembly language directly in the source code (so called inline assembly). Programs using such facilities can then construct abstractions using different assembly language on each hardware platform. The system's portable code can then use these processor-specific components through a uniform interface. Assembly language is useful in reverse engineering. Many programs are distributed only in machine code form which is straightforward to translate into assembly language by a disassembler, but more difficult to translate into a higher-level language through a decompiler. Tools such as the Interactive Disassembler make extensive use of disassembly for such a purpose. This technique is used by hackers to crack commercial software, and competitors to produce software with similar results from competing companies. Assembly language is used to enhance speed of execution, especially in early personal computers with limited processing power and RAM. Assemblers can be used to generate blocks of data, with no high-level language overhead, from formatted and commented source code, to be used by other code.\",\n",

The 8086 and several other CPUs from the late 1970s/early 1980s have redundancies in their instruction sets, because it was simpler for engineers to design these CPUs (to fit on silicon chips of limited sizes) with the redundant codes than to eliminate them (see don't-care terms). Each assembler will typically generate only one of two or more redundant instruction encodings, but a disassembler will usually recognize any of them. ^ AMD manufactured second-source Intel 8086, 8088, and 80286 CPUs, and perhaps 8080A and 8085A CPUs, under license from Intel, but starting with the 80386, Intel refused to share their x86 CPU designs with anyone—AMD sued about this for breach of contract—and AMD designed, made, and sold 32-bit and 64-bit x86-family CPUs without Intel's help or endorsement. ^ In 7070 Autocoder, a macro definition is a 7070 macro generator program that the assembler calls; Autocoder provides special macros for macro generators to use.\",\n",

      "  \"history\": \"After the release of Miranda by Research Software Ltd. in 1985, interest in lazy functional languages grew. By 1987, more than a dozen non-strict, purely functional programming languages existed. Miranda was the most widely used, but it was proprietary software. At the conference on Functional Programming Languages and Computer Architecture (FPCA '87) in Portland, Oregon, there was a strong consensus that a committee be formed to define an open standard for such languages. The committee's purpose was to consolidate existing functional languages into a common one to serve as a basis for future research in functional-language design.\",\n",
      "  \"haskell__to_\": \"Haskell was developed by a committee, attempting to bring together off the shelf solutions where possible. Type classes, which enable type-safe operator overloading, were first proposed by Philip Wadler and Stephen Blott to address the ad-hoc handling of equality types and arithmetic overloading in languages at the time. In early versions of Haskell up until and including version 1.2, user interaction and input/output (IO) were handled by both streams based and continuation based mechanisms which were widely considered unsatisfactory. In version 1.3, monadic IO was introduced, along with the generalisation of type classes to higher kinds (type constructors). Along with do notation, which provides syntactic sugar for the Monad type class, this gave Haskell an effect system that maintained referential transparency and was convenient. Other notable changes in early versions were the approach to the 'seq' function, which creates a data dependency between values, and is used in lazy languages to avoid excessive memory consumption; with it moving from a type class to a standard function to make refactoring more practical. The first version of Haskell (Haskell 1.0) was defined in 1990. The committee's efforts resulted in a series of language definitions (1.0, 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4). Hierarchy of type classes in the Haskell prelude as of GHC 7.10. The inclusion of Foldable and Traversable (with corresponding changes to the type signatures of some functions), and of Applicative as intermediate between Functor and Monad, are deviations from the Haskell 2010 standard.\",\n",
      "  \"haskell_\": \"In early 2006, the process of defining a successor to the Haskell 98 standard, informally named Haskell Prime, began. This was intended to be an ongoing incremental process to revise the language definition, producing a new revision up to once per year. The first revision, named Haskell 2010, was announced in November 2009 and published in July 2010. Haskell 2010 is an incremental update to the language, mostly incorporating several well-used and uncontroversial features previously enabled via compiler-specific flags. Hierarchical module names. Module names are allowed to consist of dot-separated sequences of capitalized identifiers, rather than only one such identifier. This lets modules be named in a hierarchical manner (e.g., Data.List instead of List), although technically modules are still in a single monolithic namespace. This extension was specified in an addendum to Haskell 98 and was in practice universally used. The foreign function interface (FFI) allows bindings to other programming languages. Only bindings to C are specified in the Report, but the design allows for other language bindings. To support this, data type declarations were permitted to contain no constructors, enabling robust nonce types for foreign data that could not be constructed in Haskell. This extension was also previously specified in an Addendum to the Haskell 98 Report and widely used. So-called n+k patterns (definitions of the form fact (n+1) = (n+1) * fact n) were no longer allowed. This syntactic sugar had misleading semantics, in which the code looked like it used the (+) operator, but in fact desugared to code using (-) and (>=). The rules of type inference were relaxed to allow more programs to type check. Some syntax issues (changes in the formal grammar) were fixed: pattern guards were added, allowing pattern matching within guards; resolution of operator fixity was specified in a simpler way that reflected actual practice; an edge case in the interaction of the language's lexical syntax of operators and comments was addressed, and the interaction of do-notation and if-then-else was tweaked to eliminate unexpected syntax errors. The LANGUAGE pragma was specified. By 2010, dozens of extensions to the language were in wide use, and GHC (among other compilers) provided the LANGUAGE pragma to specify individual extensions with a list of identifiers. Haskell 2010 compilers are required to support the Haskell2010 extension and are encouraged to support several others, which correspond to extensions added in Haskell 2010.\",\n",
      "  \"future_standards\": \"The next formal specification had been planned for 2020. On 29 October 2021, with GHC version 9.2.1, the GHC2021 extension was released. While this is not a formal language spec, it combines several stable, widely-used GHC extensions to Haskell 2010.\",\n",
      "  \"features\": \"Main article: Haskell features See also: Glasgow Haskell Compiler § Extensions to Haskell Haskell features lazy evaluation, lambda expressions, pattern matching, list comprehension, type classes and type polymorphism. It is a purely functional programming language, which means that functions generally have no side effects. A distinct construct exists to represent side effects, orthogonal to the type of functions. A pure function can return a side effect that is subsequently executed, modeling the impure functions of other languages. Haskell has a strong, static type system based on Hindley–Milner type inference. Its principal innovation in this area is type classes, originally conceived as a principled way to add overloading to the language, but since finding many more uses. The construct that represents side effects is an example of a monad: a general framework which can model various computations such as error handling, nondeterminism, parsing and software transactional memory. They are defined as ordinary datatypes, but Haskell provides some syntactic sugar for their use. Haskell has an open, published specification, and multiple implementations exist. Its main implementation, the Glasgow Haskell Compiler (GHC), is both an interpreter and native-code compiler that runs on most platforms. GHC is noted for its rich type system incorporating recent innovations such as generalized algebraic data types and type families. The Computer Language Benchmarks Game also highlights its high-performance implementation of concurrency and parallelism. An active, growing community exists around the language, and more than 5,400 third-party open-source libraries and tools are available in the online package repository Hackage.\",\n",

      "  \"implementations\": \"All listed implementations are distributed under open source licenses. Implementations that fully or nearly comply with the Haskell 98 standard include: The Glasgow Haskell Compiler (GHC) compiles to native code on many different processor architectures, and to ANSI C, via one of two intermediate languages: C--, or in more recent versions, LLVM (formerly Low Level Virtual Machine) bitcode. GHC has become the de facto standard Haskell dialect. There are libraries (e.g., bindings to OpenGL) that work only with GHC. GHC was also distributed with the Haskell platform. GHC features an asynchronous runtime that also schedules threads across multiple CPU cores similar to the Go runtime. Jhc, a Haskell compiler written by John Meacham, emphasizes speed and efficiency of generated programs and exploring new program transformations. Ajhc is a fork of Jhc. The Utrecht Haskell Compiler (UHC) is a Haskell implementation from Utrecht University. It supports almost all Haskell 98 features plus many experimental extensions. It is implemented using attribute grammars and is primarily used for research on generated type systems and language extensions. Implementations no longer actively maintained include: The Haskell User's Gofer System (Hugs) is a bytecode interpreter. It was once one of the implementations used most widely, alongside the GHC compiler, but has now been mostly replaced by GHCi. It also comes with a graphics library. HBC is an early implementation supporting Haskell 1.4. It was implemented by Lennart Augustsson in, and based on, Lazy ML. It has not been actively developed for some time. nhc98 is a bytecode compiler focusing on minimizing memory use. The York Haskell Compiler (Yhc) was a fork of nhc98, with the goals of being simpler, more portable and efficient, and integrating support for Hat, the Haskell tracer. It also had a JavaScript backend, allowing users to run Haskell programs in web browsers. Implementations not fully Haskell 98 compliant, and using a variant Haskell language, include: Eta and Frege are dialects of Haskell targeting the Java virtual machine. Gofer is an educational dialect of Haskell, with a feature called constructor classes, developed by Mark Jones. It is supplanted by Haskell User's Gofer System (Hugs). Helium, a newer dialect of Haskell. The focus is on making learning easier via clearer error messages by disabling type classes as a default.\",\n",

      "  \"criticism\": \"Jan-Willem Maessen, in 2002, and Simon Peyton Jones, in 2003, discussed problems associated with lazy evaluation while also acknowledging the theoretical motives for it. In addition to purely practical considerations such as improved performance, they note that lazy evaluation makes it more difficult for programmers to reason about the performance of their code (particularly its space use). Bastiaan Heeren, Daan Leijen, and Arjan van IJzendoorn in 2003 also observed some stumbling blocks for Haskell learners: The subtle syntax and sophisticated type system of Haskell are a double edged sword—highly appreciated by experienced programmers but also a source of frustration among beginners, since the generality of Haskell often leads to cryptic error messages. To address the error messages researchers from Utrecht University developed an advanced interpreter called Helium, which improved the user-friendliness of error messages by limiting the generality of some Haskell features. In particular it disables type classes by default. Ben Lippmeier designed Disciple as a strict-by-default (lazy by explicit annotation) dialect of Haskell with a type-and-effect system, to address Haskell's difficulties in reasoning about lazy evaluation and in using traditional data structures such as mutable arrays. He argues (p. 20) that destructive update furnishes the programmer with two important and powerful tools ... a set of efficient array-like data structures for managing collections of objects, and ... the ability to broadcast a new value to all parts of a program with minimal burden on the programmer. Robert Harper, one of the authors of Standard ML, has given his reasons for not using Haskell to teach introductory programming. Among these are the difficulty of reasoning about resource use with non-strict evaluation, that lazy evaluation complicates the definition of datatypes and inductive reasoning, and the inferiority of Haskell's (old) class system compared to ML's module system. Haskell's build tool, Cabal, has historically been criticized for poorly handling multiple versions of the same library, a problem known as Cabal hell. The Stackage server and Stack build tool were made in response to these criticisms. Cabal itself has since addressed this problem by borrowing ideas from Nix, with the new approach becoming the default in 2019.\",\n",
      "  \"related_languages\": \"Clean is a close, slightly older relative of Haskell. Its biggest deviation from Haskell is in the use of uniqueness types instead of monads for input/output (I/O) and side effects.

Elm, a functional language to create web front-end apps, no support for user-defined or higher-kinded type classes or instances. Epigram, a functional language with dependent types suitable for proving properties of programs. Idris, a general purpose functional language with dependent types, developed at the University of St Andrews. PureScript transpiles to JavaScript. Ωmega, a strict language that allows introduction of new kinds, and programming at the type level. Other related languages include: Curry, a functional/logic programming language based on Haskell.

The lead developers of Mosaic then founded the Netscape corporation, which released a more polished browser, Netscape Navigator, in 1994. This quickly became the most-used. During these formative years of the Web, web pages could only be static, lacking the capability for dynamic behavior after the page was loaded in the browser. There was a desire in the flourishing web development scene to remove this limitation, so in 1995, Netscape decided to add a programming language to Navigator. They pursued two routes to achieve this: collaborating with Sun Microsystems to embed the Java language, while also hiring Brendan Eich to embed the Scheme language. The goal was a language for the masses, to help nonprogrammers create dynamic, interactive Web sites. Netscape management soon decided that the best option was for Eich to devise a new language, with syntax similar to Java and less like Scheme or other extant scripting languages. Although the new language and its interpreter implementation were called LiveScript when first shipped as part of a Navigator beta in September 1995, the name was changed to JavaScript for the official release in December. The choice of the JavaScript name has caused confusion, implying that it is directly related to Java. At the time, the dot-com boom had begun and Java was a popular new language, so Eich considered the JavaScript name a marketing ploy by Netscape.\",\n",
      "  \"adoption_by_microsoft\": \"Microsoft debuted Internet Explorer in 1995, leading to a browser war with Netscape. On the JavaScript front, Microsoft created its own interpreter called JScript. Microsoft first released JScript in 1996, alongside initial support for CSS and extensions to HTML. Each of these implementations was noticeably different from their counterparts in Netscape Navigator. These differences made it difficult for developers to make their websites work well in both browsers, leading to widespread use of best viewed in Netscape and best viewed in Internet Explorer logos for several years.\",\n",
      "  \"the_rise_of_jscript\": \"Brendan Eich later said of this period: It's still kind of a sidekick language. It's considered slow or annoying. People do pop-ups or those scrolling messages in the old status bar at the bottom of your old browser. In November 1996, Netscape submitted JavaScript to Ecma International, as the starting point for a standard specification that all browser vendors could conform to. This led to the official release of the first ECMAScript language specification in June 1997. The standards process continued for a few years, with the release of ECMAScript 2 in June 1998 and ECMAScript 3 in December 1999. Work on ECMAScript 4 began in 2000. However, the effort to fully standardize the language was undermined by Microsoft gaining an increasingly dominant position in the browser market. By the early 2000s, Internet Explorer's market share reached 95%. This meant that JScript became the de facto standard for client-side scripting on the Web. Microsoft initially participated in the standards process and implemented some proposals in its JScript language, but eventually it stopped collaborating on ECMA work. Thus ECMAScript 4 was mothballed.\",\n",
      "  \"growth_and_standardization\": \"Logo of Technical Committee 39 (TC39), the committee of Ecma International that is responsible for maintaining the standard During the period of Internet Explorer dominance in the early 2000s, client-side scripting was stagnant. This started to change in 2004, when the successor of Netscape, Mozilla, released the Firefox browser. Firefox was well received by many, taking significant market share from Internet Explorer. In 2005, Mozilla joined ECMA International, and work started on the ECMAScript for XML (E4X) standard. This led to Mozilla working jointly with Macromedia (later acquired by Adobe Systems), who were implementing E4X in their ActionScript 3 language, which was based on an ECMAScript 4 draft. The goal became standardizing ActionScript 3 as the new ECMAScript 4. To this end, Adobe Systems released the Tamarin implementation as an open source project. However, Tamarin and ActionScript 3 were too different from established client-side scripting, and without cooperation from Microsoft, ECMAScript 4 never reached fruition. Meanwhile, very important developments were occurring in open-source communities not affiliated with ECMA work. In 2005, Jesse James Garrett released a white paper in which he coined the term Ajax and described a set of technologies, of which JavaScript was the backbone, to create web applications where data can be loaded in the background, avoiding the need for full page reloads. This sparked a renaissance period of JavaScript, spearheaded by open-source libraries and the communities that formed around them. Many new libraries were created, including jQuery, Prototype, Dojo Toolkit, and MooTools. Google debuted its Chrome browser in 2008, with the V8 JavaScript engine that was faster than its competition. The key innovation was just-in-time compilation (JIT), so other browser vendors needed to overhaul their engines for JIT. In July 2008, these disparate parties came together for a conference in Oslo. This led to the eventual agreement in early 2009 to combine all relevant work and drive the language forward. The result was the ECMAScript 5 standard, released in December 2009.\",\n",
      "  \"reaching_maturity\": \"Ambitious work on the language continued for several years, culminating in an extensive collection of additions and refinements being formalized with the publication of ECMAScript 6 in 2015. The creation of Node.js in 2009 by Ryan Dahl sparked a significant increase in the usage of JavaScript outside of web browsers. Node combines the V8 engine, an event loop, and I/O APIs, thereby providing a stand-alone JavaScript runtime system. As of 2018, Node had been used by millions of developers, and npm had the most modules of any package manager in the world. The ECMAScript draft specification is currently maintained openly on GitHub, and editions are produced via regular annual snapshots. Potential revisions to the language are vetted through a comprehensive proposal process. Now, instead of edition numbers, developers check the status of upcoming features individually. The current JavaScript ecosystem has many libraries and frameworks, established programming practices, and substantial usage of JavaScript outside of web browsers. Plus, with the rise of single-page applications and other JavaScript-heavy websites, several transpilers have been created to aid the development process.\",\n",

Server-side usage eventually started to grow in the late 2000s, with the creation of Node.js and other approaches. Electron, Cordova, React Native, and other application frameworks have been used to create many applications with behavior implemented in JavaScript. Other non-browser applications include Adobe Acrobat support for scripting PDF documents and GNOME Shell extensions written in JavaScript. Oracle used to provide Nashorn, a JavaScript interpreter, as part of their Java Development Kit (JDK) API library along with jjs a command line interpreter as of JDK version 8. It was removed in JDK 15. As a replacement Oracle offered GraalJS which can also be used with the OpenJDK which allows one to create and reference Java objects in JavaScript code and add runtime scripting in JavaScript to applications written in Java. JavaScript has been used in some embedded systems, usually by leveraging Node.js.\",\n",
      "  \"javascript_engine\": \"This section is an excerpt from List of JavaScript engines.[edit] The first engines for JavaScript were mere interpreters of the source code, but all relevant modern engines use just-in-time compilation for improved performance. JavaScript engines are typically developed by web browser vendors, and every major browser has one. In a browser, the JavaScript engine runs in concert with the rendering engine via the Document Object Model and Web IDL bindings. However, the use of JavaScript engines is not limited to browsers; for example, the V8 engine is a core component of the Node.js runtime system. They are also called ECMAScript engines, after the official name of the specification. With the advent of WebAssembly, some engines can also execute this code in the same sandbox as regular JavaScript code.\",\n",
      "  \"runtime_system\": \"A JavaScript engine must be embedded within a runtime system (such as a web browser or a standalone system) to enable scripts to interact with the broader environment. The runtime system includes the necessary APIs for input/output operations, such as networking, storage, and graphics, and provides the ability to import scripts. JavaScript is a single-threaded language. The runtime processes messages from a queue one at a time, and it calls a function associated with each new message, creating a call stack frame with the function's arguments and local variables. The call stack shrinks and grows based on the function's needs. When the call stack is empty upon function completion, JavaScript proceeds to the next message in the queue. This is called the event loop, described as run to completion because each message is fully processed before the next message is considered. However, the language's concurrency model describes the event loop as non-blocking: program I/O is performed using events and callback functions. This means, for example, that JavaScript can process a mouse click while waiting for a database query to return information. The notable standalone runtimes are Node.js, Deno, and Bun.\",\n",

      "  \"imperative_and_structured\": \"Main article: Structured programming JavaScript supports much of the structured programming syntax from C (e.g., if statements, while loops, switch statements, do while loops, etc.). One partial exception is scoping: originally JavaScript only had function scoping with var; block scoping was added in ECMAScript 2015 with the keywords let and const. Like C, JavaScript makes a distinction between expressions and statements. One syntactic difference from C is automatic semicolon insertion, which allow semicolons (which terminate statements) to be omitted.\",\n",
      "  \"weakly_typed\": \"Main article: Weakly typed JavaScript is weakly typed, which means certain types are implicitly cast depending on the operation used. The binary + operator casts both operands to a string unless both operands are numbers. This is because the addition operator doubles as a concatenation operator The binary - operator always casts both operands to a number Both unary operators (+, -) always cast the operand to a number. However, + always casts to Number (binary64) while - preserves BigInt (integer) Values are cast to strings like the following: Strings are left as-is Numbers are converted to their string representation Arrays have their elements cast to strings after which they are joined by commas (,) Other objects are converted to the string [object Object] where Object is the name of the constructor of the object Values are cast to numbers by casting to strings and then casting the strings to numbers. These processes can be modified by defining toString and valueOf functions on the prototype for string and number casting respectively. JavaScript has received criticism for the way it implements these conversions as the complexity of the rules can be mistaken for inconsistency. For example, when adding a number to a string, the number will be cast to a string before performing concatenation, but when subtracting a number from a string, the string is cast to a number before performing subtraction. JavaScript type conversions left operand operator right operand result [] (empty array) + [] (empty array)  (empty string) [] (empty array) + {} (empty object) [object Object] (string) false (boolean) + [] (empty array) false (string) 123(string) + 1 (number) 1231 (string) 123 (string) - 1 (number) 122 (number) 123 (string) - abc (string) NaN (number) Often also mentioned is {} + [] resulting in 0 (number). This is misleading: the {} is interpreted as an empty code block instead of an empty object, and the empty array is cast to a number by the remaining unary + operator. If the expression is wrapped in parentheses - ({} + []) – the curly brackets are interpreted as an empty object and the result of the expression is [object Object] as expected.\",\n",
      "  \"dynamic\": \"Main article: Dynamic Programming\",\n",
      "  \"typing\": \"Main article: Dynamic typing JavaScript is dynamically typed like most other scripting languages. A type is associated with a value rather than an expression. For example, a variable initially bound to a number may be reassigned to a string. JavaScript supports various ways to test the type of objects, including duck typing.\",\n",

      "  \"object_orientation_prototype_based\": \"Prototypal inheritance in JavaScript is described by Douglas Crockford as: You make prototype objects, and then ... make new instances. Objects are mutable in JavaScript, so we can augment the new instances, giving them new fields and methods. These can then act as prototypes for even newer objects. We don't need classes to make lots of similar objects... Objects inherit from objects. What could be more object oriented than that? In JavaScript, an object is an associative array, augmented with a prototype (see below); each key provides the name for an object property, and there are two syntactical ways to specify such a name: dot notation (obj.x = 10) and bracket notation (obj[x] = 10). A property may be added, rebound, or deleted at run-time. Most properties of an object (and any property that belongs to an object's prototype inheritance chain) can be enumerated using a for...in loop.\",\n",
      "  \"prototypes\": \"Main article: Prototype-based programming JavaScript uses prototypes where many other object-oriented languages use classes for inheritance, but it's still possible to simulate most class-based features with the prototype system. Additionally, ECMAScript version 6 (released June 2015) introduced the keywords class, extends and super, which serve as syntactic sugar to abstract the underlying prototypal inheritance system with a more conventional interface. Constructors are declared by specifying a method named constructor, and all classes are automatically subclasses of the base class Object, similarly to Java. class Person { constructor(name) { this.name = name; } } class Student extends Person { constructor(name, id) { super(name); this.id = id; } } const bob = new Student(Robert, 12345); console.log(bob.name); // Robert Though the underlying object mechanism is still based on prototypes, the newer syntax is similar to other object oriented languages. Private variables are declared by prefixing the field name with a number sign (#), and polymorphism is not directly supported, although it can be emulated by manually calling different functions depending on the number and type of arguments provided.\",\n",
      "  \"functions_as_object_constructors\": \"Functions double as object constructors, along with their typical role. Prefixing a function call with new will create an instance of a prototype, inheriting properties and methods from the constructor (including properties from the Object prototype). ECMAScript 5 offers the Object.create method, allowing explicit creation of an instance without automatically inheriting from the Object prototype (older environments can assign the prototype to null). The constructor's prototype property determines the object used for the new object's internal prototype. New methods can be added by modifying the prototype of the function used as a constructor. // This code is completely equivalent to the previous snippet function Person(name) { this.name = name; } function Student(name, id) { Person.call(this, name); this.id = id; } var bob = new Student(Robert, 12345); console.log(bob.name); // Robert JavaScript's built-in classes, such as Array and Object, also have prototypes that can be modified.

      "  \"functions_as_methods\": \"Main article: Method (computer science) Unlike in many object-oriented languages, in JavaScript there is no distinction between a function definition and a method definition.

Variables defined without keywords will be defined at the global scope. Arrow functions were first introduced in 6th Edition – ECMAScript 2015. They shorten the syntax for writing functions in JavaScript. Arrow functions are anonymous, so a variable is needed to refer to them in order to invoke them after their creation, unless surrounded by parenthesis and executed immediately. Here is an example of JavaScript syntax. // Declares a function-scoped variable named `x`, and implicitly assigns the // special value `undefined` to it. Variables without value are automatically // set to undefined. // var is generally considered bad practice and let and const are usually preferred. var x; // Variables can be manually set to `undefined` like so let x2 = undefined; // Declares a block-scoped variable named `y`, and implicitly sets it to // `undefined`. The `let` keyword was introduced in ECMAScript 2015. let y; // Declares a block-scoped, un-reassignable variable named `z`, and sets it to // a string literal. The `const` keyword was also introduced in ECMAScript 2015, // and must be explicitly assigned to. // The keyword `const` means constant, hence the variable cannot be reassigned // as the value is `constant`. const z = this value cannot be reassigned!; // Declares a global-scoped variable and assigns 3. This is generally considered // bad practice, and will not work if strict mode is on. t = 3; // Declares a variable named `myNumber`, and assigns a number literal (the value // `2`) to it. let myNumber = 2; // Reassigns `myNumber`, setting it to a string literal (the value `foo`). // JavaScript is a dynamically-typed language, so this is legal. myNumber = foo; Note the comments in the examples above, all of which were preceded with two forward slashes.

      "  \"security\": \"See also: Browser security JavaScript and the DOM provide the potential for malicious authors to deliver scripts to run on a client computer via the Web. Browser authors minimize this risk using two restrictions. First, scripts run in a sandbox in which they can only perform Web-related actions, not general-purpose programming tasks like creating files. Second, scripts are constrained by the same-origin policy: scripts from one website do not have access to information such as usernames, passwords, or cookies sent to another site. Most JavaScript-related security bugs are breaches of either the same origin policy or the sandbox. There are subsets of general JavaScript—ADsafe, Secure ECMAScript (SES)—that provide greater levels of security, especially on code created by third parties (such as advertisements). Closure Toolkit is another project for safe embedding and isolation of third-party JavaScript and HTML. Content Security Policy is the main intended method of ensuring that only trusted code is executed on a Web page.\",\n",
      "  \"cross_site_scripting\": \"Main article: Cross-site scripting A common JavaScript-related security problem is cross-site scripting (XSS), a violation of the same-origin policy. XSS vulnerabilities occur when an attacker can cause a target Website, such as an online banking website, to include a malicious script in the webpage presented to a victim. The script in this example can then access the banking application with the privileges of the victim, potentially disclosing secret information or transferring money without the victim's authorization. One important solution to XSS vulnerabilities is HTML sanitization. Some browsers include partial protection against reflected XSS attacks, in which the attacker provides a URL including malicious script. However, even users of those browsers are vulnerable to other XSS attacks, such as those where the malicious code is stored in a database. Only correct design of Web applications on the server-side can fully prevent XSS. XSS vulnerabilities can also occur because of implementation mistakes by browser authors.\",\n",
      "  \"cross_site_request_forgery\": \"Main article: Cross-site request forgery Another cross-site vulnerability is cross-site request forgery (CSRF). In CSRF, code on an attacker's site tricks the victim's browser into taking actions the user did not intend at a target site (like transferring money at a bank). When target sites rely solely on cookies for request authentication, requests originating from code on the attacker's site can carry the same valid login credentials of the initiating user. In general, the solution to CSRF is to require an authentication value in a hidden form field, and not only in the cookies, to authenticate any request that might have lasting effects. Checking the HTTP Referrer header can also help. JavaScript hijacking is a type of CSRF attack in which a <script> tag on an attacker's site exploits a page on the victim's site that returns private information such as JSON or JavaScript. Possible solutions include: requiring an authentication token in the POST and GET parameters for any response that returns private information.\",\n",
      "  \"misplaced_trust_in_the_client\": \"Developers of client-server applications must recognize that untrusted clients may be under the control of attackers. The author of an application should not assume that their JavaScript code will run as intended (or at all) because any secret embedded in the code could be extracted by a determined adversary. Some implications are: Website authors cannot perfectly conceal how their JavaScript operates because the raw source code must be sent to the client. The code can be obfuscated, but obfuscation can be reverse-engineered. JavaScript form validation only provides convenience for users, not security. If a site verifies that the user agreed to its terms of service, or filters invalid characters out of fields that should only contain numbers, it must do so on the server, not only the client. Scripts can be selectively disabled, so JavaScript cannot be relied on to prevent operations such as right-clicking on an image to save it. It is considered very bad practice to embed sensitive information such as passwords in JavaScript because it can be extracted by an attacker. Prototype pollution is a runtime vulnerability in which attackers can overwrite arbitrary properties in an object's prototype.\",\n",

Such systems allow a developer to easily manage their program's dependencies upon other developers' program libraries. Developers trust that the maintainers of the libraries will keep them secure and up to date, but that is not always the case. A vulnerability has emerged because of this blind trust. Relied-upon libraries can have new releases that cause bugs or vulnerabilities to appear in all programs that rely upon the libraries. Inversely, a library can go unpatched with known vulnerabilities out in the wild. In a study done looking over a sample of 133,000 websites, researchers found 37% of the websites included a library with at least one known vulnerability. The median lag between the oldest library version used on each website and the newest available version of that library is 1,177 days in ALEXA, and development of some libraries still in active use ceased years ago. Another possibility is that the maintainer of a library may remove the library entirely. This occurred in March 2016 when Azer Koçulu removed his repository from npm.

For example, a buffer overrun exploit can allow an attacker to gain access to the operating system's API with superuser privileges. These flaws have affected major browsers including Firefox, Internet Explorer, and Safari. Plugins, such as video players, Adobe Flash, and the wide range of ActiveX controls enabled by default in Microsoft Internet Explorer, may also have flaws exploitable via JavaScript (such flaws have been exploited in the past).

In Windows XP Service Pack 2, Microsoft demoted JScript's privileges in Internet Explorer. Microsoft Windows allows JavaScript source files on a computer's hard drive to be launched as general-purpose, non-sandboxed programs (see: Windows Script Host).

      "  \"early_concept\": \"According to Matsumoto, Ruby was conceived in 1993. In a 1999 post to the Ruby-Talk mailing list, he shared some of his early ideas about the language: I was talking with my colleague about the possibility of an object-oriented scripting language. I knew Perl (Perl4, not Perl5), but I didn't like it really, because it had the smell of a toy language (it still has). The object-oriented language seemed very promising. I knew Python then. But I didn't like it, because I didn't think it was a true object-oriented language – OO features appeared to be add-on to the language. As a language maniac and OO fan for 15 years, I really wanted a genuine object-oriented, easy-to-use scripting language. I looked for but couldn't find one. So I decided to make it. Matsumoto described Ruby's design as resembling a simple Lisp language at its core, with an object system like that of Smalltalk, blocks inspired by higher-order functions, and practical utility like that of Perl. The name Ruby originated during an online chat session between Matsumoto and Keiju Ishitsuka on 24 February 1993, before any code had been written. Two names were initially proposed: Coral and Ruby. Matsumoto chose the latter in a subsequent email to Ishitsuka. He also noted that one factor influencing the choice of the name was that a colleague's birthstone was ruby.\",\n",
      "  \"early_releases\": \"The first public release of Ruby 0.95 was announced on Japanese domestic newsgroups on 21 December 1995. Subsequently, three more versions of Ruby were released in two days. The release coincided with the launch of the Japanese-language ruby-list mailing list, which was the first mailing list for the new language. Already present at this stage of development were many of the features familiar in later releases of Ruby, including object-oriented design, classes with inheritance, mixins, iterators, closures, exception handling and garbage collection. After the release of Ruby 0.95 in 1995, several stable versions of Ruby were released in these years. In 1997, the first article about Ruby was published on the Web. In the same year, Matsumoto was hired by netlab.jp to work on Ruby as a full-time developer. In 1998, the Ruby Application Archive was launched by Matsumoto, along with a simple English-language homepage for Ruby. In 1999, the first English language mailing list ruby-talk began, which signaled a growing interest in the language outside Japan. In this same year, Matsumoto and Keiju Ishitsuka wrote the first book on Ruby, The Object-oriented Scripting Language Ruby (オブジェクト指向スクリプト言語 Ruby), which was published in Japan in October 1999. It would be followed in the early 2000s by around 20 books on Ruby published in Japanese. By 2000, Ruby was more popular than Python in Japan. In September 2000, the first English language book Programming Ruby was printed, which was later freely released to the public, further widening the adoption of Ruby amongst English speakers. In early 2002, the English-language ruby-talk mailing list was receiving more messages than the Japanese-language ruby-list, demonstrating Ruby's increasing popularity in the non-Japanese speaking world.\",\n",
      "  \"ruby__and_\": \"Ruby 1.8 was initially released August 2003, was stable for a long time, and was retired June 2013. Although deprecated, there is still code based on it. Ruby 1.8 is only partially compatible with Ruby 1.9.[citation needed] Ruby 1.8 has been the subject of several industry standards. The language specifications for Ruby were developed by the Open Standards Promotion Center of the Information-Technology Promotion Agency (a Japanese government agency) for submission to the Japanese Industrial Standards Committee (JISC) and then to the International Organization for Standardization (ISO). It was accepted as a Japanese Industrial Standard (JIS X 3017) in 2011 and an international standard (ISO/IEC 30170) in 2012. Ruby on Rails logo Around 2005, interest in the Ruby language surged in tandem with Ruby on Rails, a web framework written in Ruby. Rails is frequently credited with increasing awareness of Ruby. Effective with Ruby 1.9.3, released 31 October 2011, Ruby switched from being dual-licensed under the Ruby License and the GPL to being dual-licensed under the Ruby License and the two-clause BSD license. Adoption of 1.9 was slowed by changes from 1.8 that required many popular third party gems to be rewritten.[citation needed]\",\n",

To achieve 3x3, Ruby 3 comes with MJIT, and later YJIT, Just-In-Time Compilers, to make programs faster, although they are described as experimental and remain disabled by default (enabled by flags at runtime). Another goal of Ruby 3.0 is to improve concurrency and two more utilities Fibre Scheduler, and experimental Ractor facilitate the goal. Ractor is light-weight and thread-safe as it is achieved by exchanging messages rather than shared objects. Ruby 3.0 introduces RBS language to describe the types of Ruby programs for static analysis. It is separated from general Ruby programs. There are some syntax enhancements and library changes in Ruby 3.0 as well. Ruby 3.1 was released on 25 December 2021. It includes YJIT, a new, experimental, Just-In-Time Compiler developed by Shopify, to enhance the performance of real world business applications. A new debugger is also included. There are some syntax enhancements and other improvements in this release. Network libraries for FTP, SMTP, IMAP, and POP are moved from default gems to bundled gems. Ruby 3.2 was released on 25 December 2022. It brings support for being run inside of a WebAssembly environment via a WASI interface. Regular expressions also receives some improvements, including a faster, memoized matching algorithm to protect against certain ReDoS attacks, and configurable timeouts for regular expression matching. Additional debugging and syntax features are also included in this release, which include syntax suggestion, as well as error highlighting. The MJIT compiler has been re-implemented as a standard library module, while the YJIT, a Rust-based JIT compiler now supports more architectures on Linux. Ruby 3.3 was released on 25 December 2023. Ruby 3.3 introduces significant enhancements and performance improvements to the language. Key features include the introduction of the Prism parser for portable and maintainable parsing, the addition of the pure-Ruby JIT compiler RJIT, and major performance boosts in the YJIT compiler. Additionally, improvements in memory usage, the introduction of an M:N thread scheduler, and updates to the standard library contribute to a more efficient and developer-friendly Ruby ecosystem. Ruby 3.4 was released on 25 December 2024. Ruby 3.4 adds it block parameter reference, changes Prism as default parser, adds Happy Eyeballs Version 2 support to socket library, improves YJIT, adds modular Garbage Collector and so on.\",\n",
      "  \"semantics_and_philosophy\": \"Yukihiro Matsumoto, the creator of Ruby Matsumoto has said that Ruby is designed for programmer productivity and fun, following the principles of good user interface design. At a Google Tech Talk in 2008 he said, I hope to see Ruby help every programmer in the world to be productive, and to enjoy programming, and to be happy. That is the primary purpose of Ruby language. He stresses that systems design needs to emphasize human, rather than computer, needs: Often people, especially computer engineers, focus on the machines. They think, By doing this, the machine will run fast. By doing this, the machine will run more effectively. By doing this, the machine will something something something. They are focusing on machines. But in fact we need to focus on humans, on how humans care about doing programming or operating the application of the machines. We are the masters. They are the slaves. Matsumoto has said his primary design goal was to make a language that he himself enjoyed using, by minimizing programmer work and possible confusion. He has said that he had not applied the principle of least astonishment (POLA) to the design of Ruby; in a May 2005 discussion on the newsgroup comp.lang.ruby, Matsumoto attempted to distance Ruby from POLA, explaining that because any design choice will be surprising to someone, he uses a personal standard in evaluating surprise. If that personal standard remains consistent, there would be few surprises for those familiar with the standard. Matsumoto defined it this way in an interview: Everyone has an individual background. Someone may come from Python, someone else may come from Perl, and they may be surprised by different aspects of the language. Then they come up to me and say, 'I was surprised by this feature of the language, so Ruby violates the principle of least surprise.' Wait. Wait. The principle of least surprise is not for you only. The principle of least surprise means principle of least my surprise. And it means the principle of least surprise after you learn Ruby very well. For example, I was a C++ programmer before I started designing Ruby. I programmed in C++ exclusively for two or three years. And after two years of C++ programming, it still surprises me. Ruby is object-oriented: every value is an object, including classes and instances of types that many other languages designate as primitives (such as integers, Booleans, and null). Because everything in Ruby is an object, everything in Ruby has certain built-in abilities called methods. Every function is a method and methods are always called on an object. Methods defined at the top level scope become methods of the Object class. Since this class is an ancestor of every other class, such methods can be called on any object. They are also visible in all scopes, effectively serving as global procedures. Ruby supports inheritance with dynamic dispatch, mixins and singleton methods (belonging to, and defined for, a single instance rather than being defined on the class). Though Ruby does not support multiple inheritance, classes can import modules as mixins. Ruby has been described as a multi-paradigm programming language: it allows procedural programming (defining functions/variables outside classes makes them part of the root, 'self' Object), with object orientation (everything is an object) or functional programming (it has anonymous functions, closures, and continuations; statements all have values, and functions return the last evaluation). It has support for introspection, reflective programming, metaprogramming, and interpreter-based threads. Ruby features dynamic typing, and supports parametric polymorphism. According to the Ruby FAQ, the syntax is similar to Perl's and the semantics are similar to Smalltalk's, but the design philosophy differs greatly from Python's.\",\n",
      "  \"features\": \"Thoroughly object-oriented with inheritance, mixins and metaclasses Dynamic typing and duck typing Everything is an expression (even statements) and everything is executed imperatively (even declarations) Succinct and flexible syntax that minimizes syntactic noise and serves as a foundation for domain-specific languages Dynamic reflection and alteration of objects to facilitate metaprogramming Lexical closures, iterators and generators, with a block syntax Literal notation for arrays, hashes, regular expressions and symbols Embedding code in strings (interpolation) Default arguments Four levels of variable scope (global, class, instance, and local) denoted by sigils or the lack thereof Garbage collection First-class continuations Strict Boolean coercion rules (everything is true except false and nil) Exception handling Operator overloading Built-in support for rational numbers, complex numbers and arbitrary-precision arithmetic Custom dispatch behavior (through method_missing and const_missing) Native threads and cooperative fibers (fibers are a 1.9/YARV feature) Support for Unicode and multiple character encodings.

      "  \"syntax\": \"Main article: Ruby syntax The syntax of Ruby is broadly similar to that of Perl and Python. Class and method definitions are signaled by keywords, whereas code blocks can be defined by either keywords or braces. In contrast to Perl, variables are not obligatorily prefixed with a sigil. When used, the sigil changes the semantics of scope of the variable. For practical purposes there is no distinction between expressions and statements. Line breaks are significant and taken as the end of a statement; a semicolon may be equivalently used. Unlike Python, indentation is not significant. One of the differences from Python and Perl is that Ruby keeps all of its instance variables completely private to the class and only exposes them through accessor methods (attr_writer, attr_reader, etc.). Unlike the getter and setter methods of other languages like C++ or Java, accessor methods in Ruby can be created with a single line of code via metaprogramming; however, accessor methods can also be created in the traditional fashion of C++ and Java. As invocation of these methods does not require the use of parentheses, it is trivial to change an instance variable into a full function, without modifying a single line of calling code or having to do any refactoring achieving similar functionality to C# and VB.NET property members. Python's property descriptors are similar, but come with a trade-off in the development process. If one begins in Python by using a publicly exposed instance variable, and later changes the implementation to use a private instance variable exposed through a property descriptor, code internal to the class may need to be adjusted to use the private variable rather than the public property. Ruby's design forces all instance variables to be private, but also provides a simple way to declare set and get methods. This is in keeping with the idea that in Ruby, one never directly accesses the internal members of a class from outside the class; rather, one passes a message to the class and receives a response.\",\n",

      "  \"alternative_implementations\": \"This section's use of red links may need cleanup. Please help improve this section. (April 2025) As of 2018[update], there are a number of alternative implementations of Ruby, including JRuby, Rubinius, and mruby. Each takes a different approach, with JRuby and Rubinius providing just-in-time compilation and mruby also providing ahead-of-time compilation. Ruby has three major alternative implementations: JRuby, a mixed Java and Ruby implementation that runs on the Java virtual machine. JRuby currently targets Ruby 3.1.x. TruffleRuby, a Java implementation using the Truffle language implementation framework with GraalVM Rubinius, a C++ bytecode virtual machine that uses LLVM to compile to machine code at runtime. The bytecode compiler and most core classes are written in pure Ruby. Rubinius currently[when?] targets Ruby 2.3.1. Other Ruby implementations include: MagLev, a Smalltalk implementation that runs on GemTalk Systems' GemStone/S VM mruby, an implementation designed to be embedded into C code, in a similar vein to Lua. It is currently being developed by Yukihiro Matsumoto and others RGSS, or Ruby Game Scripting System, a proprietary implementation that is used by the RPG Maker series of software for game design and modification of the RPG Maker engine julializer, a transpiler (partial) from Ruby to Julia. It can be used for a large speedup over e.g. Ruby or JRuby implementations (may only be useful for numerical code). Topaz, a Ruby implementation written in Python Opal, a web-based interpreter that compiles Ruby to JavaScript Other now defunct Ruby implementations were: MacRuby, a Mac OS X implementation on the Objective-C runtime. Its iOS counterpart is called RubyMotion IronRuby an implementation on the .NET Framework Cardinal, an implementation for the Parrot virtual machine Ruby Enterprise Edition, often shortened to ree, an implementation optimized to handle large-scale Ruby on Rails projects HotRuby, a JavaScript and ActionScript implementation of the Ruby programming language The maturity of Ruby implementations tends to be measured by their ability to run the Ruby on Rails (Rails) framework, because it is complex to implement and uses many Ruby-specific features. The point when a particular implementation achieves this goal is called the Rails singularity. The reference implementation, JRuby, and Rubinius are all able to run Rails unmodified in a production environment.\",\n",

      "  \"history\": \"James Strachan first talked about the development of Groovy on his blog in August 2003. In March 2004, Groovy was submitted to the JCP as JSR 241 and accepted by ballot. Several versions were released between 2004 and 2006. After the Java Community Process (JCP) standardization effort began, the version numbering changed, and a version called 1.0 was released on January 2, 2007. After various betas and release candidates numbered 1.1, on December 7, 2007, Groovy 1.1 Final was released and immediately renumbered as Groovy 1.5 to reflect the many changes made. In 2007, Groovy won the first prize at JAX 2007 innovation award. In 2008, Grails, a Groovy web framework, won the second prize at JAX 2008 innovation award. In November 2008, SpringSource acquired the Groovy and Grails company (G2One). In August 2009 VMware acquired SpringSource. In April 2012, after eight years of inactivity, the Spec Lead changed the status of JSR 241 to dormant. Strachan had left the project silently a year before the Groovy 1.0 release in 2007.[citation needed] In Oct 2016, Strachan stated I still love groovy (jenkins pipelines are so groovy!), java, go, typescript and kotlin. On July 2, 2012, Groovy 2.0 was released, which, among other new features, added static compiling and static type checking. When the Pivotal Software joint venture was spun-off by EMC Corporation (EMC) and VMware in April 2013, Groovy and Grails formed part of its product portfolio. Pivotal ceased sponsoring Groovy and Grails from April 2015. That same month, Groovy changed its governance structure from a Codehaus repository to a Project Management Committee (PMC) in the Apache Software Foundation via its incubator. Groovy graduated from Apache's incubator and became a top-level project in November 2015. On February 7, 2020, Groovy 3.0 was released. Version 4.0 was released on January 25, 2022.\",\n",
      "  \"features\": \"Most valid Java files are also valid Groovy files. Although the two languages are similar, Groovy code can be more compact, because it does not need all the elements that Java needs. This makes it possible for Java programmers to learn Groovy gradually by starting with familiar Java syntax before acquiring more Groovy programming idioms. Groovy features not available in Java include both static and dynamic typing (with the keyword def), operator overloading, native syntax for lists and associative arrays (maps), native support for regular expressions, polymorphic iteration, string interpolation, added helper methods, and the safe navigation operator ?. to check automatically for null pointers (for example, variable?.method(), or variable?.field). Since version 2, Groovy also supports modularity (shipping only the jars that the project uses, thus reducing the size of Groovy's library), type checking, static compilation, Project Coin syntax enhancements, multicatch blocks and ongoing performance enhancements using the invokedynamic instruction introduced in Java 7. Groovy natively supports markup languages such as XML and HTML by using an inline Document Object Model (DOM) syntax. This feature enables the definition and manipulation of many types of heterogeneous data assets with a uniform and concise syntax and programming methodology.[citation needed] Unlike Java, a Groovy source code file can be executed as an (uncompiled) script, if it contains code outside any class definition, if it is a class with a main method, or if it is a Runnable or GroovyTestCase. A Groovy script is fully parsed, compiled, and generated before executing (similar to Python and Ruby). This occurs under the hood, and the compiled version is not saved as an artifact of the process.\",\n",
      "  \"groovybeans_properties\": \"GroovyBeans are Groovy's version of JavaBeans. Groovy implicitly generates getters and setters. In the following code, setColor(String color) and getColor() are implicitly generated. The last two lines, which appear to access color directly, are actually calling the implicitly generated methods. class AGroovyBean { String color } def myGroovyBean = new AGroovyBean() myGroovyBean.setColor('baby blue') assert myGroovyBean.getColor() == 'baby blue' myGroovyBean.color = 'pewter' assert myGroovyBean.color == 'pewter' Groovy offers simple, consistent syntax for handling lists and maps, reminiscent of Java's array syntax. def movieList = ['Dersu Uzala', 'Ran', 'Seven Samurai'] // Looks like an array, but is a list assert movieList == 'Seven Samurai' movieList = 'Casablanca' // Adds an element to the list assert movieList.size() == 4 def monthMap = [ 'January' : 31, 'February' : 28, 'March' : 31 ] // Declares a map assert monthMap['March'] == 31 // Accesses an entry monthMap['April'] = 30 // Adds an entry to the map assert monthMap.size() == 4\",\n",
      "  \"prototype_extension\": \"Groovy offers support for prototype extension through ExpandoMetaClass, Extension Modules (only in Groovy 2), Objective-C-like Categories and DelegatingMetaClass. ExpandoMetaClass offers a domain-specific language (DSL) to express the changes in the class easily, similar to Ruby's open class concept: Number.metaClass { sqrt = { Math.sqrt(delegate) } } assert 9.sqrt() == 3 assert 4.sqrt() == 2 Groovy's changes in code through prototyping are not visible in Java, since each attribute/method invocation in Groovy goes through the metaclass registry. The changed code can only be accessed from Java by going to the metaclass registry. Groovy also allows overriding methods as getProperty(), propertyMissing() among others, enabling the developer to intercept calls to an object and specify an action for them, in a simplified aspect-oriented way. The following code enables the class java.lang.String to respond to the hex property: enum Color { BLACK('#000000'), WHITE('#FFFFFF'), RED('#FF0000'), BLUE('#0000FF') String hex Color(String hex) { this.hex = hex } } String.metaClass.getProperty = { String property -> def stringColor = delegate if (property == 'hex') { Color.values().find { it.name().equalsIgnoreCase stringColor }?.hex } } assert WHITE.hex == #FFFFFF assert BLUE.hex == #0000FF assert BLACK.hex == #000000 assert GREEN.hex == null The Grails framework uses metaprogramming extensively to enable GORM dynamic finders, like User.findByName('Josh') and others.\",\n",
      "  \"dot_and_parentheses\": \"Groovy's syntax permits omitting parentheses and dots in some situations. The following groovy code take(coffee).with(sugar, milk).and(liquor) can be written as take coffee with sugar, milk and liquor enabling the development of domain-specific languages (DSLs) that look like plain English.\",\n",
      "  \"functional_programming\": \"Although Groovy is mostly an object-oriented language, it also offers functional programming features.\",\n",
      "  \"closures\": \"According to Groovy's documentation: Closures in Groovy work similar to a 'method pointer', enabling code to be written and run in a later point in time. Groovy's closures support free variables, i.e. variables that have not been explicitly passed as a parameter to it, but exist in its declaration context, partial application (that it terms 'currying'), delegation, implicit, typed and untyped parameters. When working on Collections of a determined type, the closure passed to an operation on the collection can be inferred: list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9] /* * Non-zero numbers are coerced to true, so when it % 2 == 0 (even), it is false. * The type of the implicit it parameter can be inferred as an Integer by the IDE. * It could also be written as: * list.findAll { Integer i -> i % 2 } * list.findAll { i -> i % 2 } */ def odds = list.findAll { it % 2 } assert odds == [1, 3, 5, 7, 9] A group of expressions can be written in a closure block without reference to an implementation and the responding object can be assigned at a later point using delegation: // This block of code contains expressions without reference to an implementation def operations = { declare 5 sum 4 divide 3 print } /* * This class will handle the operations that can be used in the closure above. Another class * could be declared having the same methods, but using, for example, webservice operations * in the calculations. */ class Expression { BigDecimal value /* * Though an Integer is passed as a parameter, it is coerced into a BigDecimal, as was * defined. If the class had a 'declare(Integer value)' method, it would be used instead. */ def declare(BigDecimal value) { this.value = value } def sum(BigDecimal valueToAdd) { this.value += valueToAdd } def divide(BigDecimal divisor) { this.value /= divisor } def propertyMissing(String property) { if (property == print) println value } } // Here is defined who is going to respond the expressions in the block of code above. operations.delegate = new Expression() operations()\",\n",
      "  \"curry\": \"Usually called partial application, this Groovy feature allows closures' parameters to be set to a default parameter in any of their arguments, creating a new closure with the bound value. Supplying one argument to the curry() method will fix argument one. Supplying N arguments will fix arguments 1 .. N. def joinTwoWordsWithSymbol = { symbol, first, second -> first + symbol + second } assert joinTwoWordsWithSymbol('#', 'Hello', 'World') == 'Hello#World' def concatWords = joinTwoWordsWithSymbol.curry(' ') assert concatWords('Hello', 'World') == 'Hello World' def prependHello = concatWords.curry('Hello') //def prependHello = joinTwoWordsWithSymbol.curry(' ', 'Hello') assert prependHello('World') == 'Hello World' Curry can also be used in the reverse direction (fixing the last N arguments) using rcurry(). def power = { BigDecimal value, BigDecimal power -> value**power } def square = power.rcurry(2) def cube = power.rcurry(3) assert power(2, 2) == 4 assert square(4) == 16 assert cube(3) == 27 Groovy also supports lazy evaluation, reduce/fold, infinite structures and immutability, among others.\",\n",
      "  \"json_and_xml_processing\": \"On JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) and XML processing, Groovy employs the Builder pattern, making the production of the data structure less verbose. For example, the following XML: <languages> <language year=1995> <name>Java</name> <paradigm>object oriented</paradigm> <typing>static</typing> </language> <language year=1995> <name>Ruby</name> <paradigm>functional, object oriented</paradigm> <typing>duck typing, dynamic</typing> </language> <language year=2003> <name>Groovy</name> <paradigm>functional, object oriented</paradigm> <typing>duck typing, dynamic, static</typing> </language> </languages> can be generated via the following Groovy code: def writer = new StringWriter() def builder = new groovy.xml.MarkupBuilder(writer) builder.languages { language(year: 1995) { name Java paradigm object oriented typing static } language (year: 1995) { name Ruby paradigm functional, object oriented typing duck typing, dynamic } language (year: 2003) { name Groovy paradigm functional, object oriented typing duck typing, dynamic, static } } and also can be processed in a streaming way through StreamingMarkupBuilder. To change the implementation to JSON, the MarkupBuilder can be swapped to JsonBuilder. To parse it and search for a functional language, Groovy's findAll method can serve: def languages = new XmlSlurper().parseText writer.toString() // Here is employed Groovy's regex syntax for a matcher (=~) that will be coerced to a // boolean value: either true, if the value contains our string, or false otherwise. def functional = languages.language.findAll { it.paradigm =~ functional } assert functional.collect { it.name } == [Groovy, Ruby]\",\n",
      "  \"string_interpolation\": \"In Groovy, strings can be interpolated with variables and expressions by using GStrings: BigDecimal account = 10.0 def text = The account shows currently a balance of $account assert text == The account shows currently a balance of 10.0 GStrings containing variables and expressions must be declared using double quotes. A complex expression must be enclosed in curly brackets. This prevents parts of it from being interpreted as belonging to the surrounding string instead of to the expression: BigDecimal minus = 4.0 text = The account shows currently a balance of ${account - minus} assert text == The account shows currently a balance of 6.0 // Without the brackets to isolate the expression, this would result: text = The account shows currently a balance of $account - minus assert text == The account shows currently a balance of 10.0 - minus Expression evaluation can be deferred by employing arrow syntax: BigDecimal tax = 0.15 text = The account shows currently a balance of ${->account - account*tax} tax = 0.10 // The tax value was changed AFTER declaration of the GString. The expression // variables are bound only when the expression must actually be evaluated: assert text == The account shows currently a balance of 9.000\",\n",
      "  \"abstract_syntax_tree_transformation\": \"According to Groovy's own documentation, When the Groovy compiler compiles Groovy scripts and classes, at some point in the process, the source code will end up being represented in memory in the form of a Concrete Syntax Tree, then transformed into an Abstract Syntax Tree. The purpose of AST Transformations is to let developers hook into the compilation process to be able to modify the AST before it is turned into bytecode that will be run by the JVM. AST Transformations provides Groovy with improved compile-time metaprogramming capabilities allowing powerful flexibility at the language level, without a runtime performance penalty. Examples of ASTs in Groovy are: Category and Mixin transformation Immutable AST Macro Newify transformation Singleton transformation among others. The testing framework Spock uses AST transformations to allow the programmer to write tests in a syntax not supported by Groovy, but the relevant code is then manipulated in the AST to valid code. An example of such a test is: def maximum of #a and #b is #c () { expect: Math.max (a, b) == c where: a | b || c 3 | 5 || 5 7 | 0 || 7 0 | 0 || 0 }\",\n",
      "  \"traits\": \"According to Groovy's documentation, Traits are a structural construct of the language that allows: composition of behaviors, runtime implementation of interfaces, behavior overriding, and compatibility with static type checking/compilation. Traits can be seen as interfaces carrying both default implementations and state. A trait is defined using the trait keyword: trait FlyingAbility { /* declaration of a trait */ String fly() { I'm flying! } /* declaration of a method inside a trait */ } Then, it can be used like a normal interface using the keyword implements: class Bird implements FlyingAbility {} /* Adds the trait FlyingAbility to the Bird class capabilities */ def bird = new Bird() /* instantiate a new Bird */ assert bird.fly() == I'm flying! /* the Bird class automatically gets the behavior of the FlyingAbility trait */ Traits allow a wide range of abilities, from simple composition to testing.\",\n",
      "  \"adoption\": \"Notable examples of Groovy adoption include: Apache OFBiz, the open-source enterprise resource planning (ERP) system, uses Groovy. Eucalyptus, a cloud management system, uses a significant amount of Groovy. Gradle is a popular build automation tool using Groovy. LinkedIn uses Groovy and Grails for some of their subsystems. Jenkins, a platform for continuous integration. With version 2, Jenkins includes a Pipeline plugin that allows for build instructions to be written in Groovy. Sky.com uses Groovy and Grails to serve massive online media content. SmartThings, an open platform for smart homes and the consumer Internet of Things, uses a security-oriented subset of Groovy SoapUI provides Groovy as a language for webservice tests development. Wired.com uses Groovy and Grails for the Product Reviews standalone section of the website. XWiki SAS uses Groovy as scripting language in their collaborative open-source product.\",\n",

      "  \"early_years_\": \"Mozilla Foundation headquarters in Mountain View, California Rust began as a personal project by Mozilla employee Graydon Hoare in 2006. Hoare started the project due to his frustration with a broken elevator in his apartment building. Hoare has stated that Rust was named for the group of fungi that are over-engineered for survival. During the time period between 2006 and 2009, Rust was not publicized to others at Mozilla and was written in Hoare's free time;: 7:50 Hoare began speaking about the language around 2009 after a small group at Mozilla became interested in the project. Hoare emphasized prioritizing good ideas from old languages over new development, citing languages including CLU (1974), BETA (1975), Mesa (1977), NIL (1981), Erlang (1987), Newsqueak (1988), Napier (1988), Hermes (1990), Sather (1990), Alef (1992), and Limbo (1996) as influences, stating many older languages [are] better than new ones, and describing the language as technology from the past come to save the future from itself.: 8:17 Early Rust developer Manish Goregaokar similarly described Rust as being based on mostly decades-old research. During the early years, the Rust compiler was written in about 38,000 lines of OCaml.: 15:34 Early Rust contained features such as explicit object-oriented programming via an obj keyword (later removed),: 10:08 and a typestates system that would allow variables of a type to be tracked along with state changes (such as going from uninitialized to initialized).: 13:12\",\n",
      "  \"mozilla_sponsorship_\": \"Mozilla officially sponsored the Rust project in 2009. Brendan Eich and other executives, intrigued by the possibility of using Rust for a safe web browser engine, placed engineers on the project including Patrick Walton, Niko Matsakis, Felix Klock, and Manish Goregaokar. A conference room taken by the project developers was dubbed the nerd cave, with a sign placed outside the door. During this time period, work had shifted from the initial OCaml compiler to a self-hosting compiler, i.e., written in Rust, based on LLVM.[note 4] The Rust ownership system was also in place by 2010. The Rust logo was developed in 2011 based on a bicycle chainring. The first public release, Rust 0.1 was released on January 20, 2012 for Windows, Linux, and MacOS. The early 2010s saw increasing involvement from open source volunteers outside of Mozilla and outside of the United States. At Mozilla, executives would eventually employ over a dozen engineers to work on Rust full time over the next decade.\",\n",
      "  \"evolution_\": \"The years from 2012 to 2015 were marked by substantial changes to the Rust type system, especially, removal of the typestate system, consolidation of other language features, and the removal of the garbage collector.: 18:36 Memory management through the ownership system was gradually consolidated and expanded to prevent memory-related bugs. By 2013, the garbage collector feature was rarely used, and was removed by the team in favor of the ownership system. Other changes during this time included the removal of pure functions, which were declared by an explicit pure annotation, in March 2013. Specialized syntax support for channels and various pointer types were removed to simplify the language.: 22:32 Rust's expansion and consolidation was influenced by developers coming from C++ (e.g., low-level performance of features), scripting languages (e.g., Cargo and package management), and functional programming (e.g., type systems development).: 30:50 Graydon Hoare stepped down from Rust in 2013. This allowed it to evolve organically under a more federated governance structure, with a core team of initially six people,: 21:45 around 30-40 developers total across various other teams,: 22:22 and a Request for Comments (RFC) process for new language features added in March 2014.: 33:47 The core team would grow to nine people by 2016: 21:45 with over 1600 proposed RFCs.: 34:08 According to Andrew Binstock writing for Dr. Dobb's Journal in January 2014, while Rust was widely viewed as a remarkably elegant language, adoption slowed because it radically changed from version to version. Rust development at this time was focused on finalizing the language features and moving towards 1.0 so it could begin promising backward compatibility.: 41:26 Six years after Mozilla sponsored its development, the first stable release, Rust 1.0, was published on May 15, 2015. A year after the release, the Rust compiler had accumulated over 1,400 contributors and there were over 5,000 third-party libraries published on the Rust package management website Crates.io.: 43:15\",\n",
      "  \"servo_and_early_adoption_\": \"Early homepage of Mozilla's Servo browser engine The development of the Servo browser engine continued in parallel with Rust, jointly funded by Mozilla and Samsung. The teams behind the two projects worked in close collaboration; new features in Rust were tested out by the Servo team, and new features in Servo were used to give feedback back to the Rust team.: 5:41 The first version of Servo was released in 2016. The Firefox web browser shipped with Rust code as of 2016 (version 45),: 53:30 but components of Servo did not appear in Firefox until September 2017 (version 57) as part of the Gecko and Quantum projects. Improvements were made to the Rust toolchain ecosystem during the years following 1.0 including Rustfmt, integrated development environment integration,: 44:56 a regular compiler testing and release cycle,: 46:48 a community code of conduct, and community discussion organized through an IRC chat.: 50:36 The earliest adoption outside of Mozilla was by individual projects at Samsung, Facebook (now Meta Platforms), Dropbox, and others including Tilde, Inc. (the company behind ember.js).: 55:44 Amazon Web Services followed in 2020. Engineers cited performance, lack of a garbage collector, safety, and pleasantness of working in the language as reasons for the adoption, while acknowledging that it was a risky bet as Rust was new technology. Amazon developers cited the fact that Rust uses half as much electricity as similar code written in Java, behind only C, as found by a study at the University of Minho, NOVA University Lisbon, and the University of Coimbra.[note 5]\",\n",
      "  \"mozilla_layoffs_and_rust_foundation_present\": \"In August 2020, Mozilla laid off 250 of its 1,000 employees worldwide, as part of a corporate restructuring caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. The team behind Servo was disbanded. The event raised concerns about the future of Rust, due to the overlap between the two projects. In the following week, the Rust Core Team acknowledged the severe impact of the layoffs and announced that plans for a Rust foundation were underway. The first goal of the foundation would be to take ownership of all trademarks and domain names, and take financial responsibility for their costs. On February 8, 2021, the formation of the Rust Foundation was announced by five founding companies: Amazon Web Services, Google, Huawei, Microsoft, and Mozilla. The foundation, led by Shane Miller for its first two years, offered $20,000 grants and other support for programmers working on major Rust features. In a blog post published on April 6, 2021, Google announced support for Rust within the Android Open Source Project as an alternative to C/C++. On November 22, 2021, the Moderation Team, which was responsible for enforcing the community code of conduct, announced their resignation in protest of the Core Team placing themselves unaccountable to anyone but themselves. In May 2022, the Rust Core Team, other lead programmers, and certain members of the Rust Foundation board implemented governance reforms in response to the incident. The Rust Foundation posted a draft for a new trademark policy on April 6, 2023, including rules for how the Rust logo and name can be used, which resulted in negative reactions from Rust users and contributors. On February 26, 2024, the U.S. White House released a 19-page press report urging software development to move to memory-safe programming languages; specifically, moving away from C and C++ and encouraging languages like C#, Go, Java, Ruby, Swift, and Rust. The report was widely interpreted as increasing interest in Rust. The report was released through the Office of the National Cyber Director.\",\n",
      "  \"syntax_and_features\": \"Rust's syntax is similar to that of C and C++, although many of its features were influenced by functional programming languages such as OCaml. Hoare has described Rust as targeted at frustrated C++ developers and emphasized features such as safety, control of memory layout, and concurrency. Safety in Rust includes the guarantees of memory safety, type safety, and lack of data races.\",\n",
      "  \"hello_world_program\": \"Below is a Hello, World! program in Rust. The fn keyword denotes a function, and the println! macro (see § Macros) prints the message to standard output. Statements in Rust are separated by semicolons. fn main() { println!(Hello, World!); }\",\n",
      "  \"variables\": \"Variables in Rust are defined through the let keyword. The example below assigns a value to the variable with name foo and outputs its value. fn main() { let foo = 10; println!(The value of foo is {foo}); } Variables are immutable by default, but adding the mut keyword allows the variable to be mutated. The following example uses //, which denotes the start of a comment. fn main() { // This code would not compile without adding mut. let mut foo = 10; println!(The value of foo is {foo}); foo = 20; println!(The value of foo is {foo}); } Multiple let expressions can define multiple variables with the same name, known as variable shadowing. Variable shadowing allows transforming variables without having to name the variables differently. The example below declares a new variable with the same name that is double the original value: fn main() { let foo = 10; // This will output The value of foo is 10 println!(The value of foo is {foo}); let foo = foo * 2; // This will output The value of foo is 20 println!(The value of foo is {foo}); } Variable shadowing is also possible for values of different types. For example, going from a string to its length: fn main() { let letters = abc; let letters = letters.len(); }\",\n",
      "  \"block_expressions_and_control_flow\": \"A block expression is delimited by curly brackets. When the last expression inside a block does not end with a semicolon, the block evaluates to the value of that trailing expression: fn main() { let x = { println!(this is inside the block); 1 + 2 }; println!(1 + 2 = {x}); } Trailing expressions of function bodies are used as the return value: fn add_two(x: i32) -> i32 { x + 2 }\",\n",
      "  \"if_expressions\": \"An if conditional expression executes code based on whether the given value is true. else can be used for when the value evaluates to false, and else if can be used for combining multiple expressions. fn main() { let x = 10; if x > 5 { println!(value is greater than five); } if x % 7 == 0 { println!(value is divisible by 7); } else if x % 5 == 0 { println!(value is divisible by 5); } else { println!(value is not divisible by 7 or 5); } } if and else blocks can evaluate to a value, which can then be assigned to a variable: fn main() { let x = 10; let new_x = if x % 2 == 0 { x / 2 } else { 3 * x + 1 }; println!({new_x}); }\",\n",
      "  \"while_loops\": \"while can be used to repeat a block of code while a condition is met. fn main() { // Iterate over all integers from 4 to 10 let mut value = 4; while value <= 10 { println!(value = {value}); value += 1; } }\",\n",
      "  \"for_loops_and_iterators\": \"For loops in Rust loop over elements of a collection. for expressions work over any iterator type. fn main() { // Using `for` with range syntax for the same functionality as above // The syntax 4..=10 means the range from 4 to 10, up to and including 10. for value in 4..=10 { println!(value = {value}); } } In the above code, 4..=10 is a value of type Range which implements the Iterator trait. The code within the curly braces is applied to each element returned by the iterator. Iterators can be combined with functions over iterators like map, filter, and sum. For example, the following adds up all numbers between 1 and 100 that are multiples of 3: (1..=100).filter(|&x| x % 3 == 0).sum()\",\n",
      "  \"loop_and_break_statements\": \"More generally, the loop keyword allows repeating a portion of code until a break occurs. break may optionally exit the loop with a value. In the case of nested loops, labels denoted by 'label_name can be used to break an outer loop rather than the innermost loop. fn main() { let value = 456; let mut x = 1; let y = loop { x *= 10; if x > value { break x / 10; } }; println!(largest power of ten that is smaller than or equal to value: {y}); let mut up = 1; 'outer: loop { let mut down = 120; loop { if up > 100 { break 'outer; } if down < 4 { break; } down /= 2; up += 1; println!(up: {up}, down: {down}); } up *= 2; } }\",\n",
      "  \"pattern_matching\": \"The match and if let expressions can be used for pattern matching. For example, match can be used to double an optional integer value if present, and return zero otherwise: fn double(x: Option<u64>) -> u64 { match x { Some(y) => y * 2, None => 0, } } Equivalently, this can be written with if let and else: fn double(x: Option<u64>) -> u64 { if let Some(y) = x { y * 2 } else { 0 } }\",\n",
      "  \"types\": \"Rust is strongly typed and statically typed, meaning that the types of all variables must be known at compilation time. Assigning a value of a particular type to a differently typed variable causes a compilation error. Type inference is used to determine the type of variables if unspecified. The default integer type is i32, and the default floating point type is f64. If the type of a literal number is not explicitly provided, it is either inferred from the context or the default type is used.\",\n",
      "  \"primitive_types\": \"Integer types in Rust are named based on the signedness and the number of bits the type takes. For example, i32 is a signed integer that takes 32 bits of storage, whereas u8 is unsigned and only takes 8 bits of storage. isize and usize take storage depending on the architecture of the computer that runs the code, for example, on computers with 32-bit architectures, both types will take up 32 bits of space. By default, integer literals are in base-10, but different radices are supported with prefixes, for example, 0b11 for binary numbers, 0o567 for octals, and 0xDB for hexadecimals. By default, integer literals default to i32 as its type. Suffixes such as 4u32 can be used to explicitly set the type of a literal. Byte literals such as b'X' are available to represent the ASCII value (as a u8) of a specific character. The Boolean type is referred to as bool which can take a value of either true or false. A char takes up 32 bits of space and represents a Unicode scalar value: a Unicode codepoint that is not a surrogate. IEEE 754 floating point numbers are supported with f32 for single precision floats and f64 for double precision floats.\",\n",
      "  \"compound_types\": \"Compound types can contain multiple values. Tuples are fixed-size lists that can contain values whose types can be different. Arrays are fixed-size lists whose values are of the same type. Expressions of the tuple and array types can be written through listing the values, and can be accessed with .index or [index]: let tuple: (u32, i64) = (3, -3); let array: [i8; 5] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]; let tuple: (bool, bool) = (true, true); let value = tuple.1; // -3 let value = array; // 3 Arrays can also be constructed through copying a single value a number of times: let array2: [char; 10] = [' '; 10];\",\n",
      "  \"user_defined_types\": \"User-defined types are created with the struct or enum keywords. The struct keyword is used to denote a record type that groups multiple related values. enums can take on different variants at runtime, with its capabilities similar to algebraic data types found in functional programming languages. Both records and enum variants can contain fields with different types. Alternative names, or aliases, for the same type can be defined with the type keyword. The impl keyword can define methods for a user-defined type. Data and functions are defined separately. Implementations fulfill a role similar to that of classes within other languages.\",\n",
      "  \"standard_library\": \"The Rust standard library defines and implements many widely used custom data types, including core data structures such as Vec, Option, and HashMap, as well as smart pointer types. Rust also provides a way to exclude most of the standard library using the attribute #![no_std]; this enables applications, such as embedded devices, which want to remove dependency code or provide their own core data structures. Internally, the standard library is divided into three parts, core, alloc, and std, where std and alloc are excluded by #![no_std]. Screenshot of crates.io in June 2022\",\n",
      "  \"pointers\": \"Summary of Rust's pointer and reference primitive types Type Description Examples &T &mut T References (immutable and mutable) let x_ref = &x; let x_ref = &mut x; Option<&T> Option<&mut T> Option wrapped reference Possibly null reference None let x_ref = Some(&x); let x_ref = Some(&mut x); Box<T> Option<Box<T>> A pointer to heap-allocated value (or possibly null pointer if wrapped in option) let boxed = Box::new(0); let boxed = Some(Box::new(Hello World)); *const T *mut T Raw pointers (immutable and mutable) Possibly null; unsafe to dereference let x_ptr = &x as *const T; let x_ptr = &mut x as *mut T; Rust does not use null pointers to indicate a lack of data, as doing so can lead to null dereferencing. Accordingly, the basic & and &mut references are guaranteed to not be null. Rust instead uses Option for this purpose: Some(T) indicates that a value is present, and None is analogous to the null pointer. Option implements a null pointer optimization, avoiding any spatial overhead for types that cannot have a null value (references or the NonZero types, for example). Unlike references, the raw pointer types *const and *mut may be null; however, it is impossible to dereference them unless the code is explicitly declared unsafe through the use of an unsafe block. Unlike dereferencing, the creation of raw pointers is allowed inside of safe Rust code.\",\n",
      "  \"type_conversion\": \"This section is an excerpt from Type conversion § Rust.[edit] Rust provides no implicit type conversion (coercion) between primitive types. But, explicit type conversion (casting) can be performed using the as keyword. let x = 1000; println!(1000 as a u16 is: {}, x as u16);\",\n",
      "  \"ownership\": \"Rust's ownership system consists of rules that ensure memory safety without using a garbage collector. At compile time, each value must be attached to a variable called the owner of that value, and every value must have exactly one owner. Values are moved between different owners through assignment or passing a value as a function parameter. Values can also be borrowed, meaning they are temporarily passed to a different function before being returned to the owner. With these rules, Rust can prevent the creation and use of dangling pointers: fn print_string(s: String) { println!({}, s); } fn main() { let s = String::from(Hello, World); print_string(s); // s consumed by print_string // s has been moved, so cannot be used any more // another print_string(s); would result in a compile error } Because of these ownership rules, Rust types are known as linear or affine types, meaning each value can be used exactly once. This enforces a form of software fault isolation as the owner of a value is solely responsible for its correctness and deallocation. When a value goes out of scope, it is dropped by running its destructor. The destructor may be programmatically defined through implementing the Drop trait. This helps manage resources such as file handles, network sockets, and locks, since when objects are dropped, the resources associated with them are closed or released automatically.\",\n",
      "  \"lifetimes\": \"Object lifetime refers to the period of time during which a reference is valid; that is, the time between the object creation and destruction. These lifetimes are implicitly associated with all Rust reference types. While often inferred, they can also be indicated explicitly with named lifetime parameters (often denoted 'a, 'b, and so on). Lifetimes in Rust can be thought of as lexically scoped, meaning that the duration of an object lifetime is inferred from the set of locations in the source code (i.e., function, line, and column numbers) for which a variable is valid. For example, a reference to a local variable has a lifetime corresponding to the block it is defined in: fn main() { let x = 5; // ------------------+- Lifetime 'a // | let r = &x; // -+-- Lifetime 'b | // | | println!(r: {}, r); // | | // | | // -+ | } // ------------------+ The borrow checker in the Rust compiler then enforces that references are only used in the locations of the source code where the associated lifetime is valid. In the example above, storing a reference to variable x in r is valid, as variable x has a longer lifetime ('a) than variable r ('b). However, when x has a shorter lifetime, the borrow checker would reject the program: fn main() { let r; // ------------------+- Lifetime 'a // | { // | let x = 5; // -+-- Lifetime 'b | r = &x; // ERROR: x does | | } // not live long -| | // enough | println!(r: {}, r); // | } // ------------------+ Since the lifetime of the referenced variable ('b) is shorter than the lifetime of the variable holding the reference ('a), the borrow checker errors, preventing x from being used from outside its scope. Lifetimes can be indicated using explicit lifetime parameters on function arguments. For example, the following code specifies that the reference returned by the function has the same lifetime as original (and not necessarily the same lifetime as prefix): fn remove_prefix<'a>(mut original: &'a str, prefix: &str) -> &'a str { if original.starts_with(prefix) { original = original[prefix.len()..]; } original } When user-defined types hold references to data, they also need to use lifetime parameters. The example below parses some configuration options from a string and creates a struct containing the options. The function parse_config also showcases lifetime elision, which reduces the need for explicitly defining lifetime parameters. use std::collections::HashMap; // This struct has one lifetime parameter, 'src. The name is only used within the struct's definition. #[derive(Debug)] struct Config<'src> { hostname: &'src str, username: &'src str, } // The '_ lifetime parameter, in this case, refers to the anonymous lifetime attached to the type // of the argument `config`. fn parse_config(config: &str) -> Config<'_> { let key_values: HashMap<_, _> = config .lines() .filter(|line| !line.starts_with('#')) .filter_map(|line| line.split_once('=')) .map(|(key, value)| (key.trim(), value.trim())) .collect(); Config { hostname: key_values[hostname], username: key_values[username], } } fn main() { let config = parse_config( r#hostname = foobar username=barfoo#, ); println!(Parsed config: {:#?}, config); } In the compiler, ownership and lifetimes work together to prevent memory safety issues such as dangling pointers.

      "  \"generics\": \"Rust's more advanced features include the use of generic functions. A generic function is given generic parameters, which allow the same function to be applied to different variable types. This capability reduces duplicate code and is known as parametric polymorphism. The following program calculates the sum of two things, for which addition is implemented using a generic function: use std::ops::Add; // sum is a generic function with one type parameter, T fn sum<T>(num1: T, num2: T) -> T where T: Add<Output = T>, // T must implement the Add trait where addition returns another T { num1 + num2 // num1 + num2 is syntactic sugar for num1.add(num2) provided by the Add trait } fn main() { let result1 = sum(10, 20); println!(Sum is: {}, result1); // Sum is: 30 let result2 = sum(10.23, 20.45); println!(Sum is: {}, result2); // Sum is: 30.68 } At compile time, polymorphic functions like sum are instantiated with the specific types the code requires; in this case, sum of integers and sum of floats. Generics can be used in functions to allow implementing a behavior for different types without repeating the same code. Generic functions can be written in relation to other generics, without knowing the actual type.\",\n",
      "  \"traits\": \"Excerpt from std::io Rust's type system supports a mechanism called traits, inspired by type classes in the Haskell language, to define shared behavior between different types. For example, the Add trait can be implemented for floats and integers, which can be added; and the Display or Debug traits can be implemented for any type that can be converted to a string. Traits can be used to provide a set of common behavior for different types without knowing the actual type. This facility is known as ad hoc polymorphism. Generic functions can constrain the generic type to implement a particular trait or traits; for example, an add_one function might require the type to implement Add. This means that a generic function can be type-checked as soon as it is defined. The implementation of generics is similar to the typical implementation of C++ templates: a separate copy of the code is generated for each instantiation. This is called monomorphization and contrasts with the type erasure scheme typically used in Java and Haskell. Type erasure is also available via the keyword dyn (short for dynamic). Because monomorphization duplicates the code for each type used, it can result in more optimized code for specific-use cases, but compile time and size of the output binary are also increased. In addition to defining methods for a user-defined type, the impl keyword can be used to implement a trait for a type. Traits can provide additional derived methods when implemented. For example, the trait Iterator requires that the next method be defined for the type. Once the next method is defined, the trait can provide common functional helper methods over the iterator, such as map or filter.\",\n",
      "  \"trait_objects\": \"Rust traits are implemented using static dispatch, meaning that the type of all values is known at compile time; however, Rust also uses a feature known as trait objects to accomplish dynamic dispatch, a type of polymorphism where the implementation of a polymorphic operation is chosen at runtime. This allows for behavior similar to duck typing, where all data types that implement a given trait can be treated as functionally equivalent. Trait objects are declared using the syntax dyn Tr where Tr is a trait. Trait objects are dynamically sized, therefore they must be put behind a pointer, such as Box. The following example creates a list of objects where each object can be printed out using the Display trait: use std::fmt::Display; let v: Vec<Box<dyn Display>> = vec![ Box::new(3), Box::new(5.0), Box::new(hi), ]; for x in v { println!({x}); } If an element in the list does not implement the Display trait, it will cause a compile-time error.\",\n",
      "  \"memory_safety\": \"Rust is designed to be memory safe. It does not permit null pointers, dangling pointers, or data races. Data values can be initialized only through a fixed set of forms, all of which require their inputs to be already initialized. Unsafe code can subvert some of these restrictions, using the unsafe keyword. Unsafe code may also be used for low-level functionality, such as volatile memory access, architecture-specific intrinsics, type punning, and inline assembly.\",\n",
      "  \"memory_management\": \"Rust does not use garbage collection. Memory and other resources are instead managed through the resource acquisition is initialization convention, with optional reference counting. Rust provides deterministic management of resources, with very low overhead. Values are allocated on the stack by default, and all dynamic allocations must be explicit. The built-in reference types using the & symbol do not involve run-time reference counting. The safety and validity of the underlying pointers is verified at compile time, preventing dangling pointers and other forms of undefined behavior. Rust's type system separates shared, immutable references of the form &T from unique, mutable references of the form &mut T. A mutable reference can be coerced to an immutable reference, but not vice versa.\",\n",
      "  \"macros\": \"Macros allow generation and transformation of Rust code to reduce repetition. Macros come in two forms, with declarative macros defined through macro_rules!, and procedural macros, which are defined in separate crates.\",\n",
      "  \"declarative_macros\": \"A declarative macro (also called a macro by example) is a macro, defined using the macro_rules! keyword, that uses pattern matching to determine its expansion. Below is an example that sums over all its arguments: macro_rules! sum { ( $initial:expr $(, $expr:expr )* $(,)? ) => { $initial $(+ $expr)* } } fn main() { let x = sum!(1, 2, 3); println!({x}); // prints 6 }\",\n",
      "  \"procedural_macros\": \"Procedural macros are Rust functions that run and modify the compiler's input token stream, before any other components are compiled. They are generally more flexible than declarative macros, but are more difficult to maintain due to their complexity. Procedural macros come in three flavors: Function-like macros custom!(...)

      "  \"interface_with_c_and_c\": \"Rust has a foreign function interface (FFI) that can be used both to call code written in languages such as C from Rust and to call Rust code from those languages. As of 2024[update], an external library called CXX exists for calling to or from C++. Rust and C differ in how they lay out structs in memory, so Rust structs may be given a #[repr(C)] attribute, forcing the same layout as the equivalent C struct.\",\n",

During each six-week release cycle, changes to nightly versions are released to beta, while changes from the previous beta version are released to a new stable version. Every two or three years, a new edition is produced. Editions are released to allow making limited breaking changes, such as promoting await to a keyword to support async/await features. Crates targeting different editions can interoperate with each other, so a crate can upgrade to a new edition even if its callers or its dependencies still target older editions. Migration to a new edition can be assisted with automated tooling.\",\n",

This enables features including autocompletion, and the display of compilation errors while editing.\",\n",
      "  \"performance\": \"Since it performs no garbage collection, Rust is often faster than other memory-safe languages. Most of Rust's memory safety guarantees impose no runtime overhead, with the exception of array indexing which is checked at runtime by default. Performance impact of array indexing bounds checks varies, but can be significant in some cases. Rust provides two modes: safe and unsafe. Safe mode is the normal one, in which most Rust is written. In unsafe mode, the developer is responsible for the code's memory safety, which is used by developers for cases where the compiler is too restrictive. Many of Rust's features are so-called zero-cost abstractions, meaning they are optimized away at compile time and incur no runtime penalty. The ownership and borrowing system permits zero-copy implementations for some performance-sensitive tasks, such as parsing. Static dispatch is used by default to eliminate method calls, except for methods called on dynamic trait objects. The compiler also uses inline expansion to eliminate function calls and statically-dispatched method invocations. Since Rust uses LLVM, all performance improvements in LLVM apply to Rust also. Unlike C and C++, Rust allows for reordering struct and enum elements to reduce the sizes of structures in memory, for better memory alignment, and to improve cache access efficiency.\",\n",
      "  \"adoption\": \"See also: Category:Rust (programming language) software Firefox has components written in Rust as part of the underlying Gecko browser engine. Rust is used in software across different domains. Components from the Servo browser engine (funded by Mozilla and Samsung) were incorporated in the Gecko browser engine underlying Firefox. In January 2023, Google (Alphabet) announced support for using third party Rust libraries in Chromium. Rust is used in several backend software projects of large web services. OpenDNS, a DNS resolution service owned by Cisco, uses Rust internally. Amazon Web Services uses Rust in performance-sensitive components of its several services. In 2019, AWS open-sourced Firecracker, a virtualization solution primarily written in Rust. Microsoft Azure IoT Edge, a platform used to run Azure services on IoT devices, has components implemented in Rust. Microsoft also uses Rust to run containerized modules with WebAssembly and Kubernetes. Cloudflare, a company providing content delivery network services, used Rust to build a new web proxy named Pingora for increased performance and efficiency. The npm package manager used Rust for its production authentication service in 2019. The Rust for Linux project has been supported in the Linux kernel since 2022. In operating systems, the Rust for Linux project, launched in 2020, merged initial support into the Linux kernel version 6.1 in late 2022. The project is active with a team of 6–7 developers, and has added more Rust code with kernel releases from 2022 to 2024, aiming to demonstrate the minimum viability of the project and resolve key compatibility blockers. The first drivers written in Rust were merged into the kernel for version 6.8. The Android developers used Rust in 2021 to rewrite existing components. Microsoft has rewritten parts of Windows in Rust. The r9 project aims to re-implement Plan 9 from Bell Labs in Rust. Rust has been used in the development of new operating systems such as Redox, a Unix-like operating system and microkernel, Theseus, an experimental operating system with modular state management, and most of Fuchsia. Rust is also used for command-line tools and operating system components, including stratisd, a file system manager and COSMIC, a desktop environment by System76. In web development, Deno, a secure runtime for JavaScript and TypeScript, is built on top of V8 using Rust and Tokio. Other notable adoptions in this space include Ruffle, an open-source SWF emulator, and Polkadot, an open source blockchain and cryptocurrency platform. Discord, an instant messaging software company, rewrote parts of its system in Rust for increased performance in 2020. In the same year, Dropbox announced that its file synchronization had been rewritten in Rust. Facebook (Meta) used Rust to redesign its system that manages source code for internal projects. In the 2024 Stack Overflow Developer Survey, 12.6% of respondents had recently done extensive development in Rust. The survey named Rust the most admired programming language every year from 2016 to 2024 (inclusive), based on the number of existing developers interested in continuing to work in the same language.[note 7] In 2024, Rust was the 6th most wanted technology, with 28.7% of developers not currently working in Rust expressing an interest in doing so.\",\n",

      "  \"history\": \"Lua was created in 1993 by Roberto Ierusalimschy, Luiz Henrique de Figueiredo and Waldemar Celes, members of the Computer Graphics Technology Group (Tecgraf) at the Pontifical Catholic University of Rio de Janeiro, in Brazil. From 1977 until 1992, Brazil had a policy of strong trade barriers (called a market reserve) for computer hardware and software, believing that Brazil could and should produce its own hardware and software. In that climate, Tecgraf's clients could not afford, either politically or financially, to buy customized software from abroad; under the market reserve, clients would have to go through a complex bureaucratic process to prove their needs couldn't be met by Brazilian companies. Those reasons led Tecgraf to implement the basic tools it needed from scratch. Lua's predecessors were the data-description and configuration languages Simple Object Language (SOL) and Data-Entry Language (DEL). They had been independently developed at Tecgraf in 1992–1993 to add some flexibility into two different projects (both were interactive graphical programs for engineering applications at Petrobras company). There was a lack of any flow-control structures in SOL and DEL, and Petrobras felt a growing need to add full programming power to them. In The Evolution of Lua, the language's authors wrote: In 1993, the only real contender was Tcl, which had been explicitly designed to be embedded into applications. However, Tcl had unfamiliar syntax, did not offer good support for data description, and ran only on Unix platforms. We did not consider LISP or Scheme because of their unfriendly syntax. Python was still in its infancy. In the free, do-it-yourself atmosphere that then reigned in Tecgraf, it was quite natural that we should try to develop our own scripting language ... Because many potential users of the language were not professional programmers, the language should avoid cryptic syntax and semantics. The implementation of the new language should be highly portable, because Tecgraf's clients had a very diverse collection of computer platforms. Finally, since we expected that other Tecgraf products would also need to embed a scripting language, the new language should follow the example of SOL and be provided as a library with a C API. Lua 1.0 was designed in such a way that its object constructors, being then slightly different from the current light and flexible style, incorporated the data-description syntax of SOL (hence the name Lua: Sol meaning Sun in Portuguese, and Lua meaning Moon). Lua syntax for control structures was mostly borrowed from Modula (if, while, repeat/until), but also had taken influence from CLU (multiple assignments and multiple returns from function calls, as a simpler alternative to reference parameters or explicit pointers), C++ (neat idea of allowing a local variable to be declared only where we need it), SNOBOL and AWK (associative arrays). In an article published in Dr. Dobb's Journal, Lua's creators also state that LISP and Scheme with their single, ubiquitous data-structure mechanism (the list) were a major influence on their decision to develop the table as the primary data structure of Lua. Lua semantics have been increasingly influenced by Scheme over time, especially with the introduction of anonymous functions and full lexical scoping. Several features were added in new Lua versions. Versions of Lua prior to version 5.0 were released under a license similar to the BSD license. From version 5.0 onwards, Lua has been licensed under the MIT License. Both are permissive free software licences and are almost identical.\",\n",
      "  \"features\": \"Lua is commonly described as a multi-paradigm language, providing a small set of general features that can be extended to fit different problem types. Lua does not contain explicit support for inheritance, but allows it to be implemented with metatables. Similarly, Lua allows programmers to implement namespaces, classes and other related features using its single table implementation; first-class functions allow the employment of many techniques from functional programming and full lexical scoping allows fine-grained information hiding to enforce the principle of least privilege. In general, Lua strives to provide simple, flexible meta-features that can be extended as needed, rather than supply a feature-set specific to one programming paradigm. As a result, the base language is light; the full reference interpreter is only about 247 kB compiled and easily adaptable to a broad range of applications. As a dynamically typed language intended for use as an extension language or scripting language, Lua is compact enough to fit on a variety of host platforms. It supports only a small number of atomic data structures such as Boolean values, numbers (double-precision floating point and 64-bit integers by default) and strings. Typical data structures such as arrays, sets, lists and records can be represented using Lua's single native data structure, the table, which is essentially a heterogeneous associative array. Lua implements a small set of advanced features such as first-class functions, garbage collection, closures, proper tail calls, coercion (automatic conversion between string and number values at run time), coroutines (cooperative multitasking) and dynamic module loading.\",\n",
      "  \"syntax\": \"The classic Hello, World! program can be written as follows, with or without parentheses:[a] print(Hello, World!) print Hello, World! The declaration of a variable, without a value. local variable The declaration of a variable with a value of 10. local students = 10 A comment in Lua starts with a double-hyphen and runs to the end of the line, similar to Ada, Eiffel, Haskell, SQL and VHDL. Multi-line strings and comments are marked with double square brackets. -- Single line comment --[[ Multi-line comment --]] The factorial function is implemented in this example: function factorial(n) local x = 1 for i = 2, n do x = x * i end return x end\",\n",
      "  \"control_flow\": \"Lua has one type of conditional test: if then end with optional else and elseif then execution control constructs. The generic if then end statement requires all three keywords: if condition then --statement body end An example of an if statement if x ~= 10 then print(x) end The else keyword may be added with an accompanying statement block to control execution when the if condition evaluates to false: if condition then --statement body else --statement body end An example of an if else statement if x == 10 then print(10) else print(x) end Execution may also be controlled according to multiple conditions using the elseif then keywords: if condition then --statement body elseif condition then --statement body else -- optional --optional default statement body end An example of an if elseif else statement if x == y then print(x = y) elseif x == z then print(x = z) else -- optional print(x does not equal any other variable) end Lua has four types of conditional loops: the while loop, the repeat loop (similar to a do while loop), the numeric for loop and the generic for loop. --condition = true while condition do --statements end repeat --statements until condition for i = first, last, delta do --delta may be negative, allowing the for loop to count down or up --statements --example: print(i) end This generic for loop would iterate over the table _G using the standard iterator function pairs, until it returns nil: for key, value in pairs(_G) do print(key, value) end Loops can also be nested (put inside of another loop). local grid = { { 11, 12, 13 }, { 21, 22, 23 }, { 31, 32, 33 } } for y, row in pairs(grid) do for x, value in pairs(row) do print(x, y, value) end end\",\n",
      "  \"functions\": \"Lua's treatment of functions as first-class values is shown in the following example, where the print function's behavior is modified: do local oldprint = print -- Store current print function as oldprint function print(s) --[[ Redefine print function. The usual print function can still be used through oldprint. The new one has only one argument.]] oldprint(s == foo and bar or s) end end Any future calls to print will now be routed through the new function, and because of Lua's lexical scoping, the old print function will only be accessible by the new, modified print. Lua also supports closures, as demonstrated below: function addto(x) -- Return a new function that adds x to the argument return function(y) --[[ When we refer to the variable x, which is outside the current scope and whose lifetime would be shorter than that of this anonymous function, Lua creates a closure.]] return x + y end end fourplus = addto(4) print(fourplus(3)) -- Prints 7 --This can also be achieved by calling the function in the following way: print(addto(4)(3)) --[[ This is because we are calling the returned function from 'addto(4)' with the argument '3' directly. This also helps to reduce data cost and up performance if being called iteratively.]] A new closure for the variable x is created every time addto is called, so that each new anonymous function returned will always access its own x parameter. The closure is managed by Lua's garbage collector, just like any other object.\",\n",
      "  \"tables\": \"Tables are the most important data structures (and, by design, the only built-in composite data type) in Lua and are the foundation of all user-created types. They are associative arrays with addition of automatic numeric key and special syntax. A table is a set of key and data pairs, where the data is referenced by key; in other words, it is a hashed heterogeneous associative array. Tables are created using the {} constructor syntax. a_table = {} -- Creates a new, empty table Tables are always passed by reference (see Call by sharing). A key (index) can be any value except nil and NaN, including functions. a_table = {x = 10} -- Creates a new table, with one entry mapping x to the number 10. print(a_table[x]) -- Prints the value associated with the string key, in this case 10. b_table = a_table b_table[x] = 20 -- The value in the table has been changed to 20. print(b_table[x]) -- Prints 20. print(a_table[x]) -- Also prints 20, because a_table and b_table both refer to the same table. A table is often used as structure (or record) by using strings as keys. Because such use is very common, Lua features a special syntax for accessing such fields. point = { x = 10, y = 20 } -- Create new table print(point[x]) -- Prints 10 print(point.x) -- Has exactly the same meaning as line above. The easier-to-read dot notation is just syntactic sugar. By using a table to store related functions, it can act as a namespace. Point = {} Point.new = function(x, y) return {x = x, y = y} -- return {[x] = x, [y] = y} end Point.set_x = function(point, x) point.x = x -- point[x] = x; end Tables are automatically assigned a numerical key, enabling them to be used as an array data type. The first automatic index is 1 rather than 0 as it is for many other programming languages (though an explicit index of 0 is allowed). A numeric key 1 is distinct from a string key 1. array = { a, b, c, d } -- Indices are assigned automatically. print(array) -- Prints b. Automatic indexing in Lua starts at 1. print(#array) -- Prints 4. # is the length operator for tables and strings. array = z -- Zero is a legal index. print(#array) -- Still prints 4, as Lua arrays are 1-based. The length of a table t is defined to be any integer index n such that t[n] is not nil and t[n+1] is nil; moreover, if t is nil, n can be zero. For a regular array, with non-nil values from 1 to a given n, its length is exactly that n, the index of its last value. If the array has holes (that is, nil values between other non-nil values), then #t can be any of the indices that directly precedes a nil value (that is, it may consider any such nil value as the end of the array). ExampleTable = { {1, 2, 3, 4}, {5, 6, 7, 8} } print(ExampleTable) -- Prints 3 print(ExampleTable) -- Prints 8 A table can be an array of objects. function Point(x, y) -- Point object constructor return { x = x, y = y } -- Creates and returns a new object (table) end array = { Point(10, 20), Point(30, 40), Point(50, 60) } -- Creates array of points -- array = { { x = 10, y = 20 }, { x = 30, y = 40 }, { x = 50, y = 60 } }; print(array.y) -- Prints 40 Using a hash map to emulate an array is normally slower than using an actual array; however, Lua tables are optimized for use as arrays to help avoid this issue.\",\n",
      "  \"metatables\": \"Extensible semantics is a key feature of Lua, and the metatable concept allows powerful customization of tables. The following example demonstrates an infinite table. For any n, fibs[n] will give the n-th Fibonacci number using dynamic programming and memoization. fibs = { 1, 1 } -- Initial values for fibs and fibs. setmetatable(fibs, { __index = function(values, n) --[[__index is a function predefined by Lua, it is called if key n does not exist.]] values[n] = values[n - 1] + values[n - 2] -- Calculate and memoize fibs[n]. return values[n] end })\",\n",
      "  \"object_oriented_programming\": \"Although Lua does not have a built-in concept of classes, object-oriented programming can be emulated using functions and tables. An object is formed by putting methods and fields in a table. Inheritance (both single and multiple) can be implemented with metatables, delegating nonexistent methods and fields to a parent object. There is no such concept as class with these techniques; rather, prototypes are used, similar to Self or JavaScript. New objects are created either with a factory method (that constructs new objects from scratch) or by cloning an existing object. Creating a basic vector object: local Vector = {} local VectorMeta = { __index = Vector} function Vector.new(x, y, z) -- The constructor return setmetatable({x = x, y = y, z = z}, VectorMeta) end function Vector.magnitude(self) -- Another method return math.sqrt(self.x^2 + self.y^2 + self.z^2) end local vec = Vector.new(0, 1, 0) -- Create a vector print(vec.magnitude(vec)) -- Call a method (output: 1) print(vec.x) -- Access a member variable (output: 0) Here, setmetatable tells Lua to look for an element in the Vector table if it is not present in the vec table. vec.magnitude, which is equivalent to vec[magnitude], first looks in the vec table for the magnitude element. The vec table does not have a magnitude element, but its metatable delegates to the Vector table for the magnitude element when it's not found in the vec table. Lua provides some syntactic sugar to facilitate object orientation. To declare member functions inside a prototype table, one can use function table:func(args), which is equivalent to function table.func(self, args). Calling class methods also makes use of the colon: object:func(args) is equivalent to object.func(object, args). That in mind, here is a corresponding class with : syntactic sugar: local Vector = {} Vector.__index = Vector function Vector:new(x, y, z) -- The constructor -- Since the function definition uses a colon, -- its first argument is self which refers -- to Vector return setmetatable({x = x, y = y, z = z}, self) end function Vector:magnitude() -- Another method -- Reference the implicit object using self return math.sqrt(self.x^2 + self.y^2 + self.z^2) end local vec = Vector:new(0, 1, 0) -- Create a vector print(vec:magnitude()) -- Call a method (output: 1) print(vec.x) -- Access a member variable (output: 0)\",\n",
      "  \"inheritance\": \"Lua supports using metatables to give Lua class inheritance. In this example, we allow vectors to have their values multiplied by a constant in a derived class. local Vector = {} Vector.__index = Vector function Vector:new(x, y, z) -- The constructor -- Here, self refers to whatever class's new -- method we call. In a derived class, self will -- be the derived class; in the Vector class, self -- will be Vector return setmetatable({x = x, y = y, z = z}, self) end function Vector:magnitude() -- Another method -- Reference the implicit object using self return math.sqrt(self.x^2 + self.y^2 + self.z^2) end -- Example of class inheritance local VectorMult = {} VectorMult.__index = VectorMult setmetatable(VectorMult, Vector) -- Make VectorMult a child of Vector function VectorMult:multiply(value) self.x = self.x * value self.y = self.y * value self.z = self.z * value return self end local vec = VectorMult:new(0, 1, 0) -- Create a vector print(vec:magnitude()) -- Call a method (output: 1) print(vec.y) -- Access a member variable (output: 1) vec:multiply(2) -- Multiply all components of vector by 2 print(vec.y) -- Access member again (output: 2) Lua also supports multiple inheritance; __index can either be a function or a table. Operator overloading can also be done; Lua metatables can have elements such as __add, __sub and so on.\",\n",
      "  \"implementation\": \"Lua programs are not interpreted directly from the textual Lua file, but are compiled into bytecode, which is then run on the Lua virtual machine (VM). The compiling process is typically invisible to the user and is performed during run-time, especially when a just-in-time compilation (JIT) compiler is used, but it can be done offline to increase loading performance or reduce the memory footprint of the host environment by leaving out the compiler. Lua bytecode can also be produced and executed from within Lua, using the dump function from the string library and the load/loadstring/loadfile functions. Lua version 5.3.4 is implemented in approximately 24,000 lines of C code. Like most CPUs, and unlike most virtual machines (which are stack-based), the Lua VM is register-based, and therefore more closely resembles most hardware design. The register architecture both avoids excessive copying of values, and reduces the total number of instructions per function. The virtual machine of Lua 5 is one of the first register-based pure VMs to have a wide use. Parrot and Android's Dalvik are two other well-known register-based VMs. PCScheme's VM was also register-based. This example is the bytecode listing of the factorial function defined above (as shown by the luac 5.1 compiler): function <factorial.lua:1,7> (9 instructions, 36 bytes at 0x8063c60) 1 param, 6 slots, 0 upvalues, 6 locals, 2 constants, 0 functions 1 LOADK 1 -1 ; 1 2 LOADK 2 -2 ; 2 3 MOVE 3 0 4 LOADK 4 -1 ; 1 5 FORPREP 2 1 ; to 7 6 MUL 1 1 5 7 FORLOOP 2 -2 ; to 6 8 RETURN 1 2 9 RETURN 0 1\",\n",
      "  \"c_api\": \"Lua is intended to be embedded into other applications, and provides a C API for this purpose. The API is divided into two parts: the Lua core and the Lua auxiliary library. The Lua API's design eliminates the need for manual reference counting (management) in C code, unlike Python's API. The API, like the language, is minimalist. Advanced functions are provided by the auxiliary library, which consists largely of preprocessor macros which assist with complex table operations. The Lua C API is stack based. Lua provides functions to push and pop most simple C data types (integers, floats, etc.) to and from the stack, and functions to manipulate tables through the stack. The Lua stack is somewhat different from a traditional stack; the stack can be indexed directly, for example. Negative indices indicate offsets from the top of the stack. For example, −1 is the top (most recently pushed value), while positive indices indicate offsets from the bottom (oldest value). Marshalling data between C and Lua functions is also done using the stack. To call a Lua function, arguments are pushed onto the stack, and then the lua_call is used to call the actual function. When writing a C function to be directly called from Lua, the arguments are read from the stack. Here is an example of calling a Lua function from C: #include <stdio.h> #include <lua.h> // Lua main library (lua_*) #include <lauxlib.h> // Lua auxiliary library (luaL_*) int main(void) { // create a Lua state lua_State *L = luaL_newstate(); // load and execute a string if (luaL_dostring(L, function foo (x,y) return x+y end)) { lua_close(L); return -1; } // push value of global foo (the function defined above) // to the stack, followed by integers 5 and 3 lua_getglobal(L, foo); lua_pushinteger(L, 5); lua_pushinteger(L, 3); lua_call(L, 2, 1); // call a function with two arguments and one return value printf(Result: %d\\\\n, lua_tointeger(L, -1)); // print integer value of item at stack top lua_pop(L, 1); // return stack to original state lua_close(L); // close Lua state return 0; } Running this example gives: $ cc -o example example.c -llua $ ./example Result: 8 The C API also provides some special tables, located at various pseudo-indices in the Lua stack. At LUA_GLOBALSINDEX prior to Lua 5.2 is the globals table, _G from within Lua, which is the main namespace. There is also a registry located at LUA_REGISTRYINDEX where C programs can store Lua values for later retrieval.\",\n",
      "  \"modules\": \"Besides standard library (core) modules it is possible to write extensions using the Lua API. Extension modules are shared objects which can be used to extend the functions of the interpreter by providing native facilities to Lua scripts. Lua scripts may load extension modules using require, just like modules written in Lua itself, or with package.loadlib. When a C library is loaded via require('foo') Lua will look for the function luaopen_foo and call it, which acts as any C function callable from Lua and generally returns a table filled with methods. A growing set of modules termed rocks are available through a package management system named LuaRocks, in the spirit of CPAN, RubyGems and Python eggs. Prewritten Lua bindings exist for most popular programming languages, including other scripting languages. For C++, there are a number of template-based approaches and some automatic binding generators.\",\n",
      "  \"applications\": \"Main article: List of applications using Lua In video game development, Lua is widely used as a scripting language, mainly due to its perceived easiness to embed, fast execution, and short learning curve. Notable games which use Lua include Roblox, Garry's Mod, World of Warcraft, Payday 2, Phantasy Star Online 2, Dota 2, Crysis, and many others. Some games that do not natively support Lua programming or scripting, have this function added by mods, as ComputerCraft does for Minecraft. Also, Lua is used in non-video game software, such as Adobe Lightroom, Moho, iClone, Aerospike, and some system software in FreeBSD and NetBSD, and used as a template scripting language on MediaWiki using the Scribunto extension. In 2003, a poll conducted by GameDev.net showed Lua was the most popular scripting language for game programming. On 12 January 2012, Lua was announced as a winner of the Front Line Award 2011 from the magazine Game Developer in the category Programming Tools. Many non-game applications also use Lua for extensibility, such as LuaTeX, an implementation of the TeX type-setting language, Redis, a key-value database, ScyllaDB, a wide-column store, Neovim, a text editor, Nginx, a web server, Wireshark, a network packet analyzer and Pure Data, a visual audio programming language (through the pdlua extension).\",\n",
